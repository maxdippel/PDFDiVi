Outgoing mail from the e-print archive has the username no-reply
(to avoid problems due to occasional mail that bounces back).
Commands to the system should always be sent to arch-ive@arXiv.org
with the command in the subject field (e.g.  Subject: help).
Only one command at a time is accepted. Subscribers automatically
receive a listing of new titles/abstracts on days papers are received.

You will have a more pleasurable time using the archives if you read this
file carefully, read ALL responses you get to your interactions
with the archives, and follow the instructions therein.

This help file summarizes the email interface commands.

This information can be more easily accessed via the WorldWideWeb
at http://arXiv.org/help/ .

==========================================================================
Additional help is available by using the `get' command to retrieve the
following files:

Summary of Commands for the e-Mail Interface:

All commands to arch-ive@xxx may be abbreviated by any truncation that includes
at least the first three letters (e.g. sub, can, dis, lis, ...).
(The term arch-ive a generic one; substitute an appropriate archive name like
hep-th when actually doing something). The command must be given in the 
subject field (e.g., Subject: help ).


Commands for retrieving information
    (get, cget, uget, list, find, distribution):

  get <paper#>  <macroname>

    Returns paper specified by paper# (e.g. `get 9109001'), or macro specified
    by macroname.
    For abstracts alone, append .abs to the paper# (e.g. `get 9109001.abs').
    Multiple requests in one `get' are allowed and preferred.
    For example, `get 3 2.abs 9108001' returns multiple papers and abstracts.
    get defaults to the current year/month so that during 10/91,
    `get 1 2 5' or `get 01 2 005' will automatically prepend 9110's and the
    necessary zeroes to result in `get 9110001 9110002 9110005'.
    Numbers too large for the current year/month will have the previous
    year/month prepended. get also defaults to the current year, e.g.
    `get 9005' during  1995 gives `get 9509005', and months/numbers too big
    for the current year default to the previous year.
    You can freely mix formats, as in `get 1 08005 harvmac.tex 9109058 2.abs'.

    As of 1 Jan 1996, the get command returns a single uuencoded, gzipped,
    tar archive containing all files in a submission (except in the case
    of a submission consisting of a single file [e.g. TeX, PS, or PDF],
    which is instead just gzipped [i.e. not tarred] and uuencoded for e-mail).
    For utilities to unpack these, read utilities.txt
    (available via `get utilities.txt'). For those unable to process this new
    format, there is now the `uget' command.
    
  cget <paper#>

    Same as the get command, but the file is cut into multiple parts
    of size < 100 kB (195 blocks) to accommodate certain capricious
    or limited mail routers and to speed bitnet transmission.

  uget <paper#>

    Same as the get command, but files are unpacked from our storage
    format (gzipped tar files) and sent out individually. Meant for those
    unable to adapt to our new (1 Jan 1996) packaging. Users should feel
    encouraged to modernize to use gzip and tar (see utilities.txt
    for more info, including cross-platform availability) in order to use
    the normal get command.

  listing

    Returns list of year/month's currently available

  list <yymm's  macros  new  pastweek>

    Returns title/author's of papers currently held for given year/month
      subset, e.g. `list 9109'.
    `list macros' returns a list of the available TeX macros and various
      utilities such as reform and uufiles.
    `list new' resends the most recently sent title/abstract listing
      of papers received (typically from the previous day).
    `list pastweek' returns past week of title/author listings.
    For title/author/abstract's of papers held for given yr/mo subsets,
       append .abs: e.g.    `list 9109.abs 9110.abs'
    multiple requests allowed: e.g. `list 9109 9110.abs macros new pastweek'

  clist <yymm.abs ...>

    Same as the list command, but files are cut into multiple parts
    of size < 100 kB (195 blocks) to accommodate certain capricious
    or limited mail routers and to speed bitnet transmission.

  find <search-string>

    Searches the title/author list for search-string (either author or word in
    title, case insensitive) to retrieve paper number, e.g. `find goldstone'.
    Find defaults to the past 12 months, so for earlier years use e.g.
    `find goldstone 91'.

  distribution <name>

    Search for `name' in e-mail distribution list.


Subscription commands
    (subscribe, cancel, subscribe all, cancel all):

  subscribe <your full name>

    Add new username to daily distribution list (e-mail address will
    automatically be extracted from return address), `your full name'
    is your full name (any number of words and initials) as you wish
    it to appear on the distribution list. <<<Note: `suscribe' is not
    a word>>> (It is of course no longer obvious why people subscribe
    for intrusive e-mail receipt of abstracts when they have www
    access on-demand from http://arXiv.org/ ). e-Mail addresses that
    bounce three consecutive times are automatically cancelled. If you do
    not receive a response to your `subscribe' message, it is most likely
    because your mailer is misconfigured and the return address in the
    From: line or Reply-To: line is broken. We have no way of contacting you
    if this is the case, so you are on your own to figure out what is wrong.

  cancel

    Remove user@nodename from daily distribution list. The e-mail address is
    extracted automatically, so cancel message must be sent from the same
    account as originally used to subscribe.
    Note that you may be subscribed instead through a remote listserv,
    or through some local preprint distribution list at your end.
    You can determine the origin of your subscription by examining the
    the header from the daily mailing you receive.
    If you no longer have access to your original subscription account,
    the administrators at arXiv.org may be able to cancel it for you.
    Send request as a comment, and be certain to
    to include the entire header of a daily abstract mailing that you have
    received so that we can determine how you are subscribed. (Do not send
    a useless header from the failed `cancel' or from a `get', etc.)

  subscribe all <password>

    Receive daily list of changes to database. The list of changes comes
    formatted in a form suitable for automated ftp scripts. The password
    will be added to the Subject: line of the daily message so that
    automated scripts can be reasonably sure that the messages are authentic.
    Don't use your account password. If you do not include a password
    then a random one will automatically be generated for you.

  cancel all

    Cancel previously entered `subscribe all'  (i.e. in order to no longer
    receive daily list of changes to database). `cancel all' will not
    cancel a regular subscription (one that sends you the complete abstracts
    each day). You must use the `cancel' command for
    each individual archive to which you are subscribed.


Commands for submitting information:
    Submission via the email interface was phased on in July 2003 in favor of 
    the web interface: see http://arxiv.org/help. (The commands put, fput, 
    replace, freplace, figures, add, cross, published are no longer used.)


Miscellaneous commands
          (comment, help):

  comment

    Forward message for human perusal. If you have any doubts about
    how to submit something or where it should go, you can use this
    command to ask questions. They are usually answered on a one day
    turn around, often sooner. Style files of use to other authors
    can also be sent in, along with a one-line description of the style.

  help

    Returns this file.


---------------------------------------------------------------------

Do not make multiple requests for the same paper. If you receive nothing
(or if the response is slow) it means there is a problem at your end.

Anonymous ftp for getting and retrieving files is enabled on arXiv.org.
use   login: anonymous
      password: yourusername

  The relevant directories are  listings  and  papers  (the latter has
  subdirectories 9108, 9109, ...  ). If you are not already familiar with
  anonymous ftp, this is not a good place to practice.
  Papers can be put on the archives via anonymous ftp using `fput' and
  `freplace' (see above,  or `get fput.txt' for further info).

For european users, many of these databases are mirrored as
the equivalent arch-ive@babbage.sissa.it, which allows access both via the
above e-mail requests and via anonymous ftp.

WorldWideWeb access is available via  http://arXiv.org/
and other mirror sites worldwide
