Instructions for Submitting to the Archive


There are three ways to transmit a submission to the archives:

 e-mail the entire submission using the put command.
   Since emailing TeX, Postscript and Pdf can be troublesome, we recommend
   packaging your paper as described in our e-mail submission help .

 ftp the submission to our incoming directory ftp://arXiv.org/incoming/
   and send the abstract via e-mail using the fput command.

 use our WorldWideWeb file upload page (requires a 1996 browser).

Here we describe general issues applicable to all three methods; go to
the above link to learn about your preferred method.
Everyone who submits should read the following information
(and recheck it occasionally for updates).


A few general guidelines:


Consider your format carefully.

Authors writing papers that will be electronically distributed need to
consider their submission format carefully from the outset.  For reasons
described below and in our faq, the preferred
format for these archives is TeX/LaTeX, and authors should use it whenever
possible. The short reason is that it makes it much likely that people will
be able to actually read your paper, because we convert TeX source into a
variety of formats, including PostScript. Thus if the paper is written in
TeX, submit the TeX, not the PostScript. However, there are disciplines in
which TeX is not widespread, and we support other submission formats.
Currently the best alternatives are html, PostScript and Adobe's newer Portable
Document Format (PDF). Below we discuss the different formats for submission.

It is important to read our response and check your submission.

After you submit your paper, you will receive a response from the archive.
It is very important that you read this response. Be sure to check for errors 
in the copy of the abstract that appears in the message. The response
to a successful submission will include a URL that will allow you to view
the PostScript version generated here, together with a username/password
for viewing it (each day's submissions are not made available to the general
public until 22:00 LANL time). Alternatively, you can download your paper using
e-mail. If you see any errors or are unhappy with the formatting, then use the
replace command or the web upload immediately to fix the problem.
There is no reason not to, because if you replace before the next mailing
is locked (18:00 LANL time Monday through Friday), it will not generate
an additional date stamp.


Replace your paper if necessary.

We encourage authors to update and to make corrections in their papers.
This is done not by making a new submission, but rather by replacing
the existing one using the replace command
or by using the web interface.  If necessary to replace, it is helpful
if you indicate in the Comments: or Notes: field (i.e. after Title: and
Authors: ) how serious the revision is (e.g. major conceptual changes, minor
grammatical changes, etc.), and include as a commented header in the revised
version of the body of the paper itself (if it is a TeX file) guide to the
changes so that interested parties need not be bothered to retrieve it again
unnecessarily.


Take responsibility.

Because putting papers on the archives entails certain responsibilities,
we prefer that authors make their own submissions. Third-party submissions
(by secretaries for example) are often the ones that cause the most problems,
presumably due to lack of self-interest and related factors. We also require
that authors provide an institutional affiliation and a report number
somewhere in the paper.


Be careful with your submission.

Abstracts of papers received by 18:00 LANL time are sent out in the next
weekday's mailing to hundreds or thousands of your esteemed colleagues.
Statistical fabrication shows that "replaced" papers are not immediately
rerequested, so if it is your intent to communicate correct research
it is in your interest to avoid premature submissions and submit only
a final version.  Incorrect papers cannot be removed after the mailing goes out
(22:00 LANL time Sunday through Thursday); they can only be replaced with
a withdrawal notification, leaving a permanent blot on your submission record.


The text

If you submit TeX/LaTeX/AmsTeX/AmsLaTeX (as do most authors), it will
automatically be converted into PostScript using our auto-TeXing script.

Common mistakes can be avoided by following the guidelines in mistakes.txt.
If your submission is rejected because it does not TeX properly, 
you will receive the log from our auto-TeXing script.  The information
contained in the response should be sufficient to identify the problem, so
examine it carefully (if your paper is rejected automatically, the tex
error will generally be at the end of the log). Please study this log;
usually the errors are easily fixed by the author. Do not send a PostScript
version to avoid having to deal with this.

If you have questions or can't fix a problem, before causing anyone bodily
harm send a comment using the comment command,
or send mail to www-admin@arXiv.org.
DO NOT send files via comment or to www-admin unless explicitly requested.

You probably don't need to send in any style files since we have copies of
all the common scientific style files already on line.  First try submitting
without style files. If you find that this doesn't work because we don't have
the style file you need then you can either include the necessary style file
in your submission and 'replace', or send them instead via the comment
command. The latter is preferred if you feel that the style or macro files
would be of interest to other authors; be sure to include a one-line
description for our summary.  If you have a personal style file, just
include it with your submission.  Plain TeX macro files (but not all LaTeX
style files) can also be included directly in to the main body of the TeX
file so that they don't need to be inputted as separate files.

Avoid inadvertently submitting your paper in double-spaced referee mode,
since it wastes paper on a global scale. Readers prefer to have a compact
single-spaced version, as it would appear in a printed journal.


The refererences

We strongly encourage you to include archive/papernum identifiers in your
reference list for both published and unpublished papers.

We recommend using standard identifiers of the form hep-ph/9409201, which is
easily harvested. For example,

\bibitem{upsilon}
C.T.H. Davies {\em et al.}, Phys. Rev {\bf D} 50 (1994) 6963, hep-lat/9406017.

Our pattern-matching searches the tex source for an archive name (lower case)
followed by a forward slash and seven digits. Do not include extraneous font
commands, spaces, tildes, braces or line-breaks within the e-print identifier:
this will cause your references to be missed.

Use of e-print identifiers is a significant aid to the SLAC Spires-HEP
database. It also facilitates automatic network hyperlinks of references from
within papers (see e.g. http://arXiv.org/hypertex/ ).
(Note that the APS allows e-print identifiers to appear in the references of
papers submitted to Physical Review.)

If you wish to include your own 7 digit paper number directly in submitted
files (typically to appear on the title page), `put' will translate
any occurrence of the sequence: arch-ive/yymmnnn (where you replace "arch-ive"
by the name of the arch-ive to which you are submitting e.g. hep-th) to
arch-ive/papernum (e.g. to hep-th/9701075) in the stored version of the paper.
This particular sequence (note 2 y's for year, 2 m's for month, 3 n's for
number) does not ordinarily occur in tex (or even postscript) files so there
should be no danger of unwanted replaced text.
Note: you should not add yymmnnn to the prepended title/abs info in
your submission, since that will be stamped automatically in the Paper: line.


The auto-texing procedure

We don't run bibtex in the auto-TeXing procedure. If you use it, include
in your submission the .bbl file which bibtex produces on your home machine;
otherwise your references will not come out correctly. We don't run bibtex
because the .bib database files can be quite large, and the only thing
necessary to make the references for a given paper is the .bbl file.
So please don't include the .bib file with your submission.

Authors should note that if you have a file named x.tex, then it will
produce a file named x.ps. In that case you should therefore not include a
file named x.ps in your submission, because .ps files with the same
basename as the .tex file will be automatically removed to allow
dvips to create the .ps file.

If your submission is plain text and should not be TeXed, then make
the first line of your file 
%auto-ignore
This ensures that it will be ignored by the auto-postscript generator.

By default, Latex files are processed using Latex2e (the current version
of Latex). If you are still using Latex 2.09, then you might wish to force
the the auto-TeXing procedure to run Latex 2.09 instead (otherwise the
formatting may come out slightly different in the final output). To do
this, make the first line of your file %&latex209


The figures

You should also submit figures that go along with your paper. It is very
easy to do so. If submitted by e-mail, you should send the TeX file plus
figures all together; follow the directions in our e-mail
submission help.  It is even easier by ftp or web upload.

These figures can be in any format people are capable of viewing.
PostScript is generally preferred, because virtually all of our readers can
view and print it. For photographic or other images, however, it may be
desirable to submit .jpg or .gif files, because these are often much smaller
and can be much higher quality than the equivalent PostScript.

We and most of our readers prefer that you use macros like epsf or psfig
to include the PostScript figures in the body of the paper. The only instance
where this may not be desirable is if a figure is large (e.g. a photo) and
you wish to give people the option of downloading the paper without it.
Unfortunately, no useful macros yet exist to include .gif or .jpg figures in
a paper.

PostScript figures which are not incorporated in the main body of the
paper should be given names of the form
figure-<number><optional letter>.ps,
e.g. figure1.ps, figure2a.ps, figure2b.ps, so that they can be automatically
sorted into the correct order for the `combined figures' link.

Avoid oversized, inefficient PostScript figures. Storage here is not a
problem, but network bandwidth is.  Overseas transmissions will frequently
crash on large files. In addition, readers using a modem do not wish to
download a half megabyte figure of a color postscript shaded cylinder, when a
few kb line drawing conveys the identical information content.  If a large
figure is necessary to the paper, include it, but make all possible efforts to
reduce its size. See sizes.txt and our bitmapping faq for more
information.  Finally, note that URL's to resources held elsewhere
can always be included in the Comments: field, Notes: field or the abstract.
Submissions will be automatically rejected if their compressed size is 
over 650kB; if you are over this limit, contact us at www-admin@arXiv.org.
If the figures are as small as they possibly can be, we can still accept
your submission. If your files are larger than 300kB, then you must read
sizes.txt and try and slim them down.


PostScript and PDF

We generate PostScript and PDF for every TeX submission to the archives.
Neither of these output formats is ideal for submission, and should only
be submitted if there is no TeX source available.

Unfortunately, many people are under the illusion that submitting PostScript
is ideal. The advantage is that proper PS is directly printable and viewable
on the screen (although some platforms don't have good public domain PostScript
previewers). PostScript as a submission format, however, has many
disadvantages: it loses all contextual information, produced naively it can
result in absurdly oversized files, it loses additional portability by fixing
the page size and resolution, it needs to be compressed and uuencoded to be
sent through e-mail, if produced by junk programs (especially on PCs and
Macs) it frequently does not conform to Adobe's specifications, Level II PS
can't always be printed on Level I printers, etc.
Authors who write in TeX should never submit PostScript, except for figure
attachments (as either .ps or [encapsulated] .eps files).

People who use word processors such as MS Word can (if all else fails)
submit PostScript, although they should ensure that PS generated by a
Windows program doesn't start with the silly "bug-fix" control-D (many
programs have an option for turning this off). 
If you submit PostScript that explicitly states a resolution, make sure you
produce the PostScript at 300 dpi since not everyone has higher resolution
printers (and the output quality can be very poor when one tries to print
high resolution PostScript to a lower resolution printer).

PDF is a new format descended from PostScript. In fact, it is
mostly specially encoded (akin to uuencoded), compressed PostScript
arranged into "objects". PDF is attractive in principle because it is designed 
to be more portable than PostScript, includes hyperlinking, allows user-added
annotations, and can transparently substitute fonts. TeX can be converted
into PDF through the hypertex macros and an enhanced version of dvips. 
We now produce PDF from all TeX submitted source. For further information
on pdf, see our pdf faq.
While PDF can be very useful, it has some of the same limitations as
PostScript. Including large PS figures can hamper the display of the document
so that it is unusable. Authors should keep in mind that not everyone will
have a high-end machine, and should compose their documents accordingly.
