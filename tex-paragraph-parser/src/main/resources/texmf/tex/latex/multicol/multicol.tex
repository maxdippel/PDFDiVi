%% Driver file for the multicol documentation:
%%
%% Normally driver files to run documents written for th doc.sty
%% option are much shorter.  But since TeX,
%% LaTeX ... is currently changing I thought it might be better
%% to put everything in. Therefore this document should run both
%% under TeX82 and TeX90 (but some line breaks will differ) under
%% the new and the old font selection scheme ...
%%
%% The options for the \documentstyle command therefore
%% depend whether you have the new font selection already.
%% (The font selection is distributed via the AMS and will also
%% be available on the servers. So please don't ask for it personally.)
%%
%% There will be some overfull boxes with TeX82.
%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\ifx\selectfont\undefined
  \documentstyle[newdoc,ltugboat]{article}
\else
  \documentstyle[oldlfont,newdoc,ltugboat]{article}
\fi

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%
%% The next section defines a few font related commands if the
%% new font selection scheme is in force.
%%
%% Additionally you have to use the oldlfont option because this was
%% written for the old LaTeX.
%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\ifx \selectfont\undefined \else

\renewcommand{\tensl}
  {\family{cmr}\series{m}\shape{sl}\size{10}{12pt}\selectfont}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%
%%  The next few lines are for those with a new TeX 3.0 to ensure
%%  that hyphenation etc. is done correctly.
