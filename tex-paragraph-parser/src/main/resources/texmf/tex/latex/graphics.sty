% Makes available command \graphics for inserting postscript graphics into
% text using the \special command as interpreted by dvips.
% Currently only works with encapsulated postscript.
%
% \graphics has 6 arguments:
%    1st arg:  name of graphics file used in \special command
%    2nd arg:  width  in \unitlength units
%    3rd arg:  height  in \unitlength units
%    4th arg:  x offset  in \unitlength units
%    5th arg:  y offset  in \unitlength units
%    6th arg:  scale factor  (1 = no change)
%
% This creates a box of the indicated width and height.
%
% There are four more commands that alter how the graphics appears
%   \framegraphics      Causes a frame to be drawn around the box created
%   \dontframegraphics  Don't draw the frame
%   \drawgraphics       Include the figure
%   \dontdrawgraphics   Don't include the figure
%
% The defaults are \dontframegraphics\drawgraphics
%
% Note that this style file sets \unitlength to 1cm.
