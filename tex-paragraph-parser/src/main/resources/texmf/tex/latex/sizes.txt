==========================================================================

Oversized Submissions

There is no size limit on submissions, provided all relevant files have
been prepared using the most appropriate size-efficient formats. As an author
you are strongly encouraged to use network resources judiciously and
to think about the time it will take people to download your paper.

Use of the appropriate tools and image formats for figures is the key to
preparing an efficient submission that will be convenient for people to
download.

Most submissions to the archives are fine, but a small percentage includes
files in inefficient and unnecessarily large formats.  As a consideration to
potential readers, we ask that you read the information below. Most oversized
figures can easily be shrunk, either by conversion to the gif or jpeg formats,
or by bitmapping.

It is very easy to make efficient bitmapped versions of figures.
Programs such as  XV (under X-Windows) allow you to ``grab'' any
displayed image off the screen and save it in other formats, such as
bitmapped PostScript, gif or jpeg. PostScript figures can be captured by
grabbing them from ghostview's display window.  Read the Bitmapping FAQ
for more information, and details on where to get XV and similar programs
for other systems.

Remember that not everyone in the world has a high-speed network
connection, and many people have to download papers at < 1kB/s. At this
speed it takes over 5 minutes to download 300kB of data, so you should start
to be concerned if the total compressed size of all the files in your
submission begins to exceed this.

To make large figures easier to download, put each one in a separate file
so that they can be downloaded individually if required. Do not try to
combine all the figures into a single file. A combined figures link is
provided for this purpose.

By following the appropriate procedures (below) you should be able to
reduce the size of any individual figure to under 50kB (gzip compressed). If
you cannot get the size below this you are probably doing something wrong
(e.g. using an inappropriate format or unnecessarily high resolution). All
the figures we have encountered can be compressed to less than 50kB without
significant loss of quality.

The top reasons for files being candidates for downsizing are:

PostScript figures with extremely large numbers of points or lines:
Data-plotting programs often take no regard for the size of the output files
they produce, with several lines of PostScript code being used to plot
each point when one would do. 

Solution: convert figures to bitmapped PostScript. (See the
Bitmapping FAQ for details) 

Images submitted as PostScript instead of gifs/jpegs:

The gif and jpeg formats have been explicitly designed for making
efficient compressed image files, while PostScript was not. 

Solution: convert images to gif or jpeg. 
(See the Bitmapping FAQ for details) 

Figures at unnecessarily high resolution or with millions of colors:

It is unnecessary to provide figures at 1200dpi in 24 bit color, even if
your scanner or software has this feature. 

Solution: regenerate the figures at lower resolution or convert to
lower resolution bitmapped mono or greyscale PostScript. 
(See the Bitmapping FAQ for details on conversions) 

PostScript figures contain unneeded/duplicated fonts or preview:

Some software includes unnecessary font definitions in every file it
produces (even if the fonts are not used). These fonts can take up hundreds
of kilobytes. This is most likely to affect files produced by Macintosh, DOS
or Windows word processors and graphics programs.

Solution: load the PostScript file into an editor and manually
remove the unwanted fonts. (See the PostScript-Junk FAQ for details) 

PostScript submitted instead of tex source:

The tex source is always more compact than the PostScript it produces
and contains the same (actually more) information. 

Solution: submit the tex source (See the Uufiles FAQ
for information on packaging TeX submissions, and the FAQ
for additional reasons why submitting tex is preferred)

Uncompressed submission:

This may not even make it over the first hurdle if sent by e-mail
(since there is a limit on the size of messages for some mailers). 

Solution: compress your submission (but uuencode it too since binary files
should not be sent by e-mail). This is all done automatically if you use
the 'uufiles' utility, which is recommended. (See the Uufiles FAQ for details.)


All submissions are examined automatically using a number of heuristics.
It is possible that you will receive a notification message asking you to
take a few simple steps to convert your biggest files into more suitable
formats down before resubmitting. Note that the heuristics for detecting these
problems have proven extremely reliable. Of the submissions which are flagged,
there are very few which cannot be compressed using more efficient formats.

Occasionally a spurious warning might be generated in the case of very long
papers, e.g., if you are submitting a long review article with many small
figures or a thesis. In reasonable cases such as this you should contact
www-admin@arXiv.org to obtain special dispensation.

If you have trouble with the size of your submission, you can send a
comment asking for guidance using the comment command,
or send e-mail to www-admin@arXiv.org.

It is not necessary to bombard us with additional e-mail copies of your files,
thank you very much, since we cache all rejected submissions for a few days.


Additional Policy Information

We encourage authors to include all relevant figures, tables, images,
etc., with their submission for archival purposes, provided these attachments
are submitted in the most efficient format. This is a slight modification
from our earlier policy of suggesting that large files be kept at the
author's site, with the URL mentioned in the comments field.  The main reason
for this change of policy is that large files at remote sites were ultimately
a disservice to interested readers. Statistically accurate samples indicate
that the vast majority of the files on these remote sites could easily have
been converted to more compact formats (e.g., gif or jpeg) and submitted
directly to the archives.  This resulted in a double whammy for hapless
readers, since the only files available were both very large (especially when
the authors omitted even to compress them) and on remote sites typically with
slower network connections than the main archive network.

Hence our policy is that all relevant files should be submitted in some form,
using the most efficient formats to make them compact (as described above).
Authors are free to provide links to larger alternative versions at
their own sites, e.g. at higher resolution, in color, or with special screen
formatting, if desired.  (We currently do not have the resources to archive
multimegabyte MPEG movies so these should remain on the author's site).
Readers regularly report their preference for a bitmapped, jpeg, or gif version
of a figure or image readily available from the archive, with an optional link
to the full original version on a remote site, rather than only a link
(which may or may not work) to a remote site. This permits easy browsing
of the figure along with the paper, and an arbitrarily augmented version  
available on demand from the author's site.
