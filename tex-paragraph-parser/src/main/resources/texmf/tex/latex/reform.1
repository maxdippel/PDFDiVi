.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program reformats .tex files to be sent out via electronic mail.
Lines of width > 80 characters get carriage returns inserted at
space or tab characters (in the absence of which the line is included 
anyway with a comment that it cannot be broken automatically),
and removes any trailing spaces or tab characters from lines.

It automatically inserts % signs when splitting off the trailing end
of lines already commented out.

It also inserts {} before any occurrences of `From' or `~' at
beginning of line, and before `.' if alone on a line, to prevent
mangling by sendmail. It converts all appearances of `>From' to `
From' in an attempt to undo previous manglings.
.SH NOTE
.PP
Sending raw TeX files by email is not advisable. It's better to encode
the file first using a utility like
.I uufiles.
