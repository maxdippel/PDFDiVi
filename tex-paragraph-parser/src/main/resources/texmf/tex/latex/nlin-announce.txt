An electronic Nonlinear Science Preprint Bulletin Board (PBB) is in 
operation as of March 5, 1993.  

The PBB provides a fully automated system for the archiving and distribution 
of electronic preprints.  Preprints are submitted electronically to the system,
which assigns them reference numbers, and makes them available to PBB users
via a wide variety of conventional means of network access.  The simplest such
access is via e-mail request, through which remote users may, for example, get 
help on available commands, obtain the full texts of papers, obtain listings
for given periods, and search for author names or keywords. The system allows
the original submitter of a paper to incorporate ongoing corrections and
addenda (and adds an entry to the daily listings with an author supplied
synopsis of any changes).  The system also permits anonymous FTP access to 
papers and macros stored in the data base, as well as access by other rapidly
developing network utilities such as WAIS, Gopher, and WorldWideWeb.  
A cross-referencing feature is available to establish linkages among bulletin 
boards in different disciplines. 

All researchers in the nonlinear science community are invited to submit 
electronic preprints to the Nonlinear Science PBB.  For purposes of 
standardization, users are encouraged, albeit not required, to submit text 
in TeX or LaTeX format, with figures in uuencoded tar-compressed postscript 
files.  (If necessary, papers may also be submitted with a note indicating 
that non-electronic figures are to be obtained directly from the authors.)
PBB subscribers are notified regularly by e-mail of new submissions. 
Listings, retrievals, and searches of preprints may be performed at any 
time without subscribing to the regular mailing service.  Usage of the 
PBB is free of charge.

The nonlinear science PBB is divided into the following categories:

[all of the above]           nlin-sys@xyz.lanl.gov    Erica Jen

                                                    * unconfirmed

Users may access and/or subscribe to any subset of the above categories, 
or to nlin-sys which contains the entire data base; preprints should 
however be submitted to only a single category since cross-linkage 
options, as explained in the documentation for any of the categories, 
eliminate the need for multiple storage.  

Information on usage of the PBB may be obtained by sending an e-mail 
message with the subject "help" and a blank message body to any of the 
above internet addresses; e.g..

To: nlin-sys@xyz.lanl.gov
Subject:  help

Included in the "help" documentation are instructions for the use of 
other commands: 

  subscribe  get    put    listing       cross      replace 
  cancel     add    find   distribution  published  comment 

typically invoked, as in the case of "help,"  by sending e-mail to the proper 
internet address with a subject consisting of the command and requisite 
arguments, together with a message body where appropriate. To subscribe to 
the full nlin-sys, for example, send e-mail with a blank message body

To: nlin-sys@xyz.lanl.gov
Subject:  subscribe [your name] 

replacing [your name] by your full name (spaces and initials allowed) as you 
wish it to appear in the distribution list.  Preprint notifications will then
be sent to the e-mail address from which you subscribed.  Any of the 
categories [chao-dyn patt-sol adap-org comp-gas solv-int] may be substituted 
for nlin-sys if you wish to subscribe only to that subset.

PBBs currently in operation in other disciplines, utilizing the same 
software and to which cross-linkages are operative, include:

alg-geom@publications.math.duke.edu  (algebraic geometry)
astro-ph@babbage.sissa.it            (astrophysics)
cond-mat@babbage.sissa.it            (condensed matter)
e-mail@xxx.lanl.gov                  (e-mail address database)
funct-an@babbage.sissa.it            (functional analysis)
gr-qc@xxx.lanl.gov                   (gravitation, quantum cosmology)
nucl-th@xxx.lanl.gov                 (nuclear physics, theory)
hep-lat@ftp.scri.fsu.edu             (computational and lattice physics)
hep-ph@xxx.lanl.gov                  (high energy physics, phenomenological)
hep-th@xxx.lanl.gov                  (high energy physics, formal)

A list is also being compiled of other electronic preprint systems (based on 
other software) in all scientific disciplines.  At present the list includes:

mp_arc@math.utexas.edu               (mathematical physics preprints)
csp2.csp.uga.edu  [128.192.19.229]   (simulational physics FTP server)

If you know of other such systems, please send e-mail as a "comment"

To:  nlin-sys@xyz.lanl.gov
Subject:  comment 

describing the scope of the system, its internet address, and "help" 
instructions.  Comments on nlin-sys may also be sent to the above address 
or to any of the category addresses, and will be forwarded if appropriate 
to the scientific advisors.
