% The World Scientific attempt at  making latex macros disables all of the
% power of latex! They also forget to deal with the math fonts by not using
% font families, which is evident in the MG6 Proceedings: 
%         the math is too small (10pt compared to 12pt text)!
% The following macros attempt to retain the power of latex and get the
% math right while modifying standard latex to give the desired format.

% Miscellaneous Preliminary Macros:

%\def\nopagenumbers{\pagestyle{empty}}              % kills header and footer
%dnm \nopagenumbers   % worldsci does the pagination; comment out in drafts

% Fonts:
% One must use the family size commands of latex to also get math fonts 
% automatically at the right size, as well as to use all the usual typeface
% changing commands. The following leads to redefinition of the family \xiipt:

% twelve point = 10 pt scaled by 20 percent for reduction back to 10pt:
%     (modifications of fonts loaded by LFONTS.TEX)
 \font\twlrm  = cmr10 scaled \magstep1     % roman  
 \font\twlmi  = cmmi10 scaled \magstep1    % math italic
 \font\twlit  = cmti10 scaled \magstep1    % text italic
 \font\twlsl  = cmsl10 scaled \magstep1    % slanted
 \font\twlbf  = cmbx10 scaled \magstep1    % extended bold 
 \font\twltt  = cmtt10 scaled \magstep1    % typewriter

%  now the baselineskip (from ART12.DOC):

% Footnotes:
% 
% Since the numbered citations are superscripts, the footnotes cannot
% use numbers for the counter since there would be  no way to distinguish
% them, so symbol footnotes are used for the title/author information and
% then lettered footnotes are used for the rest:

\newcommand{\symbolfootnotes}{\renewcommand{\thefootnote}
        {\fnsymbol{footnote}}}

\newcommand{\alphafootnotes}
        {\setcounter{footnote}{0}

% section macros:

\typeout{ >> MG7tex note: Warning! These sectioning commands are not 
intelligent enough to avoid bad breaks between the section title and text.}

% some info on the latex \section command from art12.doc:

% \@startsection {NAME}{LEVEL}{INDENT}{BEFORESKIP}{AFTERSKIP}{STYLE} 
%            optional * [ALTHEADING]{HEADING}
%    Generic command to start a section.  
%    NAME       : e.g., 'subsection'
%    LEVEL      : a number, denoting depth of section -- e.g., section=1,
%                 subsection = 2, etc.  A section number will be printed if
%                 and only if LEVEL < or = the value of the secnumdepth
%                 counter.
%    INDENT     : Indentation of heading from left margin
%    BEFORESKIP : Absolute value = skip to leave above the heading.  
%                 If negative, then paragraph indent of text following 
%                 heading is suppressed.
%    AFTERSKIP  : if positive, then skip to leave below heading,
%                       else - skip to leave to right of run-in heading.
%    STYLE      : commands to set style
%  If '*' missing, then increments the counter.  If it is present, then
%  there should be no [ALTHEADING] argument.  A sectioning command
%  is normally defined to \@startsection + its first six arguments.

%\def\section{\@startsection {section}{1}{\z@}{-3.5ex plus -1ex minus 
%    -.2ex}{2.3ex plus .2ex}{\Large\bf}}
%\def\subsection{\@startsection{subsection}{2}{\z@}{-3.25ex plus -1ex minus 
%   -.2ex}{1.5ex plus .2ex}{\large\bf}}
%\def\subsubsection{\@startsection{subsubsection}{3}{\z@}{-3.25ex plus
% -1ex minus -.2ex}{1.5ex plus .2ex}{\normalsize\bf}}
%\def\paragraph{\@startsection
%     {paragraph}{4}{\z@}{3.25ex plus 1ex minus .2ex}{-1em}{\normalsize\bf}}
%\def\subparagraph{\@startsection
%     {subparagraph}{4}{\parindent}{3.25ex plus 1ex minus 
%     .2ex}{-1em}{\normalsize\bf}}


% Remarks:
% The World Scientific beforeskip of .6cm plus only a 12pt baselineskip 
%    for the section title is replaced with .5cm and uniform 14pt baselineskip 
%    throughout; the extra 2pt = .703mm nearly makes up for the missing .1cm.
% For the afterskip I reduced the space a little bit, for appearance and
% since most of us are short on space with only a 2 (3?) page limit.

% Bibliography:
% They seem to want extra left margin compared to the standard

% some of these choices, so I will use the standard latex choices.

% remove square brackets from reference list numbers
