.ll -8
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program creates a tarfile from a set of files, compresses (or
gzips) it, and then uuencodes it for e\-mail. Running the program
without options will use the GNU gzip compression utility by default
(if it is in your path). If gzip is not available then the older unix
compress is used.

Further instructions are given in the program. The final uuencoded
compressed tarfile file will be created in the current directory with
the suffix .uu.

Single files are not tarred, just compressed and uuencoded.
.SS OPTIONS
.TP
.I \-9
use 'gzip -9' compression (the highest compression level)
.SH EXAMPLE

The following example shows the typical usage of 'uufiles'

.nf
bjg|vvv> uufiles
will use gzip to compress
directory with files to archive (default is /physics/lat95/hep-lat): .
files in . (e.g. *.ps, file1 file2 file3, or * for all): *.tex *.sty *.ps
(here are the files that will be packed:
   fnal-improv.tex f_pi_systematics.ps m_q_systematics.ps espcrc2.sty
 carriage return or ctrl-C at next query to exit in case of problem)
output file (will create name.tar.gz uuencoded as name.uu) name: paper

 Switching to directory  .  and creating file  paper.uu  from
espcrc2.sty          fnal-improv.tex
f_pi_systematics.ps  m_q_systematics.ps
 result: -rw-r--r--   1 bjg      users       1138 May 28 13:03 paper.uu

finished. to invert:  uudecode paper.uu
  gunzip -c paper.tar.gz | tar -xvf -  (or  gnutar zxvf paper.tar.gz)
or execute  csh paper.uu  (which removes paper.uu and paper.tar.gz)
