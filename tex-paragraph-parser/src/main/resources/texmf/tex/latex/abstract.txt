In order to present a consistent 'look and feel' to the archives, and to
categorize information, we have adopted a specific format for the abstracts
that authors submit. The abstract is divided into two sections delimited by
three sets of double backslashes (\\). A properly formatted abstract begins
with a line containing only \\.  This is followed by fields for the title,
authors, comments, and for the papers local preprint number, and another
\\. Then comes the abstract itself followed by a final \\.

Abstracts are reformatted during the put process, so it is important to
adhere to the format. The script that does the processing tries to correct
for common mistakes, but it is better not to make them in the first place.
The most important reformatting is line-wrapping to 80 characters. This is
fine for most abstracts, but there are occasions when lines shouldn't be
wrapped, e.g. if the abstract is a table of contents. To provide for this,
lines with leading white space are not wrapped. Thus, you should not submit
an abstract that contains leading white space unless you explicitly don't
want wrapping.

The whole abstract between the first and third \\'s should not be longer
than 24 80-character lines so that it can be displayed on a VT100 terminal.
Abstracts that exceed this limit are cut to fit. You will have to abridge
your abstract if it doesn't fit.

Here is a template of the submission format (if you use it, don't leave
in the <'s and >'s):

\\
Title: <title of paper with no blank lines>
Author(s): <list of authors (parenthetical optional affiliations)>
Comments: <optional comments, including number of pages, special
  macros if any> 
Report-no: <optional report number as assigned by your institution>
\\
    <Abstract of the paper (or other short description).>
\\

And here is an example:

\\
Title: Recent Seminal Results in the Theory of Everything
  that I have been Working on Recently
Authors: Sew-Soo Mee (Eastern Fundamental Institute) and Ahl-Sioux Yoo
  (Eschatological Fantasies, Inc.)
Comments: 12 pages, 3 Postscript figures, uses rotate.sty
  mpeg simulations available at ftp://myhost.domain/path/file.mpg
  or at http://myhost.mydomain/RSR/file.mpg
Report-no: EFI-94-11
\\
  This paper explains everything about everything, thereby 
making redundant all other papers in the field.  Applications
to text compression should be obvious.

Salient features (or what you should and should not do):

- Each field is capitalized and followed immediately by a colon and a
  space. There is no space between the field name and the :. Each
  field begins on a new line and the field name appears at the beginning
  of the line.
- The Title: and Authors: field are mandatory. 
- The Comments: field is strongly encouraged, and should at least
  contain the number of pages, the submission format, and indicate if
  there are figures.
- The Report-no: field is last and contains only a local preprint
  number. No other information should appear there (put any
  miscellaneous information in the Comments: field). If you include a
  local preprint number, use the Report-no: field, don't put it in the
  Comments: field.
- An author's affiliation is enclosed in parentheses. Do not put a
  full mailing address. At most, you can include a city and country.
- Anonymous ftp and World Wide Web locations are given in the standard
  Uniform Resource Locator (URL) format. The archive's WWW interface
  translates these automatically into active links. It is not
  necessary to include HTML directives. This is done automatically.
  Also, an ftp URL will be replaced by the text "this ftp URL" and an
  http URL with "this http URL", so make sure this substitution results
  in something grammatically correct.
- It is not necessary to include the submitter's email address since
  this will always appear with the abstract. You should only do so if
  there are multiple authors or if your email address differs from the
  one used for the submission.
- You should remove all extraneous TeX/LaTeX directives. There is no
  need to include extra \\'s, {}'s, to escape characters that TeX treats
  specially (e.g. \&), or to use \noindent's.
- You should not include the word "Abstract" (or any misspellings of
  it) in the abstract section; it is redundant.
- If you want to specify a journal where the paper will appear, put
  that information in Comments: section. If it has already appeared, use
  the published command to add this information after submitting the paper.
- Title and author names are written with normal capitalization, not
  all upper case.
- Don't add your own fields (e.g. Keywords:, Pages:, Preprint:). They
  will just be wrapped incorrectly.
If you follow these guidelines, you should have no troubles. When you put
your submission, you will receive a response that includes a copy of your
abstract EXACTLY as it would appear in the next mailing. If there are any
problems with it, replace your paper and correct your mistakes.
