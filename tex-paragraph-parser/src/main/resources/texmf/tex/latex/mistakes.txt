Common mistakes in papers
...that cause automated source to postscript conversion to fail...

For more information about our postscript generation system, see
http://arXiv.org/faq/psfaq.html

The following mistakes are in no particular order,
and are all avoidable if authors take enough care.


---------------------------------------------------------------------

Absolute filenames
When including style/macro files, authors sometimes write the filename
as an absolute filename, e.g.

/users/staff/fred/article.sty

instead of a relative one, e.g.

article.sty

Absolute filenames make it impossible for anyone to use the source
without modifying it.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Missing style/macro files

Be sure to send, with the source, any style/macro files which we don't have.
Some authors write their own style/macro files, but forget to include them
with the source.
N.B. non-standard style/macro 
provided along with the source must NOT be attached to a paper.
Submit them as separate files (e.g. via FTP), or use tar
to combine them into one file before submitting.
Avoid mailing tar files unless they are first compressed
and uuencoded. Failure to uuencode a tar or compressed tar file
will result in transmission errors.



---------------------------------------------------------------------
Last minute untested changes
All too often, an author will make a last minute change to the source,
but won't  test it to see if the results will TeX correctly.
You can save yourself a lot of embarassment by testing that everything
works properly before submitting your paper.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
User intervention
Our source to postscript conversion system is fully automated.
There won't be a user on hand to answer questions such as,
Would you like (P)ortrait or (L)andscape ? - answer P/L

If your source needs to ask these types of question, please create a file
called filename.inp (where filename matches the file it
is to act on - see examples below), which contains suitable responses.
You should assume that your audience is international, but probably weighted
towards being US based. 

Test your .inp file as follows...e.g.


cat myfile.inp | tex myfile.tex
   or
cat fred.inp | latex fred.tex
   etc  



---------------------------------------------------------------------
Multiple files concatenated
Do not submit several files all concatenated into one file.. the
files cannot be separated automatically. Instead, please use tar and
then compress the tarfile.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Use of old or non-standard style files
Style files change with time, you (or we) might be using old versions of
style files. We try to keep up to date, so if problems arise due 
to style files, please check the version you are using is current.

Some well known style files e.g. epsf.sty have been altered by TeX
programmers, then uploaded to FTP sites under the same filename. This is
very bad practice and anti-social behavior since we end up with
multiple versions of standard styles.

This archive will make every effort to support the most recent and
official versions of standard style files.


---------------------------------------------------------------------

Style files incompatible with dvips
Style files which are incompatible with dvips, e.g. 
epsbox.sty can cause problems. If the dvi needs exotic versions
of dvips (e.g. jdvi2kps) to produce postscript, then this
will cause our automated system to fail.
Please make every effort to avoid using non-standard styles and
dvi2ps utilities. Few people will be able to process papers in these
non-standard formats.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Sources which rely on something other than TeX or LaTeX
All papers should be formatted so they work with TeX or LaTeX (as
appropriate). If you use amstex, amslatex, aatex for example,
then please add the appropriate line to the top of the source, e.g.

%&amslplain

for AMS-LaTeX,

\input amstex

or

%&amstex

for AMS-TeX, and


\input cp-aa.tex

or

%&cp-aa

for Springer-Verlag's Plain TeX Astronomy & Astrophysics macros, cp-aa
also known as aatex


Anything that relies on something other than TeX or LaTeX
to be run, will fail.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Use of unusual/uncommon fonts
Authors should keep in mind that if they use unusual fonts, many
potential readers of your work won't have them installed. If you really 
need to use uncommon fonts, please ask www-admin@arXiv.org to 
install them, so that the archive can povide both source and
postscript versions of your work. You should provide us with a pointer 
to a location where the necessary font files can be downloaded.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Marking files to be ignored
If you need to include files in the source, which should
not be processed by the automated system, you should add,

%auto-ignore

near the top of the file. This directive can be anywhere in the first
10 lines of the file, and anywhere on the line. It should appear before
any TeX or LaTeX commands, since they will be recognized first. e.g.


This is a README file for paper hep-ex/9901003
%auto-ignore
