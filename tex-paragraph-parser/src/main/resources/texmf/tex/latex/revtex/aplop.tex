\begin{abstract}
Complex optical computer designs must implicitly or explicitly allow for
power budgeting, to compensate for cross talk and loss in both devices and
interconnections.  We develop algorithms for calculating the system cross
talk and power loss in optical systems, using a graph-theoretic model.
Devices are modeled as directed graphs with nodes representing inputs and
outputs, and edges are weighted with the power relationships between nodes.
Systems are modeled by interconnecting the individual device graphs in a
manner that reflects the connectivity of the system.  A system's power
budget is efficiently computed by a depth-first search of its graph.  The
algorithms have been incorporated into an optical computer-aided design
system that is now being used to design a bit-serial optical computer
containing hundreds of components.

Key words: Optical computing, optical systems, optical communications,
power loss, cross talk, graphs.

\section{ Introduction}
We describe a technique that facilitates the design of digital optical
computers and other complex optical circuitry, such as optical
communications systems.  Although there has been some discussion in the
literature of power budgeting in optical systems,\cite{1,2} the treatment
has been limited to relatively uncomplicated applications, in which
heuristics and simple analysis are sufficient to estimate power loss and
cross talk of the system from the loss and cross talk of individual
components.  The primary motivation for this research is to implement a
stored-program bit-serial optical computer,\cite{3,4} containing hundreds
of components, interconnected in quite complex fashion.  In such a system,
simple heuristics for power loss and cross talk estimation such as are
described in Refs.\ \onlinecite{1} and \onlinecite{2} are inadequate
because a given optical signal might take any one of a multitude of paths
before being detected and thus doing useful work.  The methods developed
here are applicable to a wide variety of optical systems besides optical
computing systems, such as optical communications systems and optical
signal processors.

In a previous paper\cite{5} we discussed the use of a graph-theoretic
technique for synchronizing optical systems that rely on time of flight
rather than latching or gating for synchronization.  In this paper we
extend these graph-theoretic methods to the estimation of cross talk and
loss in optical systems.

\section{Power Loss and Cross Talk in the System}

\subsection{ Introduction}
Appropriate signal levels must be maintained in any digital optical system
that uses signal level thresholds to encode transmitted information.
Usually a high-level signal represents a logic 1 and a low-level signal
represents a logic 0.  In these systems the device characteristics of
importance are power loss and cross talk.  Power loss quantifies the
attenuation of optical power in devices.  Cross talk represents the
addition of extraneous optical power to signals transmitted by these
devices.  \ldots

\ldots We present a graph-theoretic device model that permits efficient and
complete power analysis of optical systems.  By tracking certain
power--related quantities, we can determine the worst--case operating
conditions of a system, and optimal logic thresholds can be computed.

The following discussion assumes either that loss and cross talk are
independent of wavelength or that linewidths are small enough to permit
these variations.

\subsection{Power Levels and Correct Device Operation}

Here we discuss the type of power information desired from a system model.
Since the objective is to find weak points in the system power flow, only
power extremes are considered.  Power extremes are the cross talk and
signal levels obtained when the worst possible combinations of device
states and input power levels are assumed.  The power extremes at detection
points are of particular interest, because these are the locations where
design flaws are expressed through signal misinterpretation.  Detection
points are places where signal power is interpreted.  Detection points in a
system may be control points where the signal level is used to control a
device; at the input to a logic gate, for example.  Or they may be output
points where the power level is detected and conveyed to an output
subsystem as a data stream.  That distinction is irrelevant for this
discussion, and we will refer to detection points in both of these cases.
Consider the problem of correctly interpreting a bit stream at some
arbitrary detection point.  Figure 1 depicts a stream of 1's and 0's
arriving at a detection point.  $ P_D $ represents the power detection
threshold of the detector: that power level below which the detector
detects a 0 and above which it detects a 1.  $ P_{S1} $ and $ P_{S2} $
define a safety zone around $ P_D$.  They are based on the uncertainty in $
P_D$ and are established so that the chance of erroneous signal
interpretation is negligible.  By definition, the device will operate
correctly as long as all 1's arriving at the detection point have power
levels greater than $ P_{S1}$ and all 0's arriving at the detection point
have power levels less than $ P_{S2}$.  The weakest 1 arriving at the
detection point under all conditions from all possible paths to the point
is defined as $P_{1\rm min}$, and similarly, the strongest 0 is defined as
$ P_{0\rm max}$.  Proper device operation can be ensured if the following
relations are met:
\begin{equation} P_{0\rm max} < P_{S2} < P_{D} < P_{S1} < P_{1\rm
min}.\label{p0}
\end{equation}
It is also desirable to have information about $ P_{\rm max} $, the maximum
power level that can occur at the inputs to a given device.  A power
detector may provide erroneous results when the power of a logic 1 arriving
at a detection point is too large; that is, when $ P_{\rm max} $ exceeds $
P_D $ by some large amount.  A second and more important reason for
computing $ P_{\rm max} $ is that it makes the major contribution to cross
talk, as discussed below.  Knowledge of the power triple $ P_{0\rm max},
P_{1\rm min}, $ and $ P_{\rm max} $ at each device in a system permits the
tracking of power levels throughout the entire system.


\subsection{ Modeling the Device}
Here we discuss the means for calculating the power triples $ P_{0\rm
max},\kern.5em P_{1\rm min}, $ and $ P_{\rm max}$ at the outputs of a given
device, given the values of the triples at each of its inputs. \ldots

\ldots The power triple for the $j$th output of a device is computed from
the input triples and the coupling terms as follows:
\begin{eqnarray}
P_{1\rm min}({\rm out})_j & = & \begin{array}[t]{c} {\rm min} \\[-15pt]
{s\in\rm states} \end{array}\, \{ \,  \begin{array}[t]{c}{\rm min}
\\[-15pt] {\rm inputs}\, i \end{array} \;  [P_{1\rm min}({\rm in})_i -
L_{ij}(s)]\}, L_{ij}(s) \; \in \;  {\rm loss},\label{p1min} \\ P_{0\rm
max}({\rm out})_j & =& \begin{array}[t]{c}{\rm max} \\[-15pt] {s\in\rm
states} \end{array}\, \sum_{{\rm inputs}\, i}\left\{ \begin{array}{l}P_{\rm
max}{\rm (in)}_i - L_{ij}(s)\;  ,\; L_{ij}(s)\in {\rm cross\,
talk},\label{p0max} \\  P_{0\rm max}({\rm in})_i - L_{ij}(s)\; ,\;
L_{ij}(s)\in {\rm loss},   \end{array} \right. \\ P_{\rm max}({\rm out})_j
&=& \begin{array}[t]{c}{\rm max} \\[-15pt] {s\in\rm states} \end{array}\,
\sum_{{\rm inputs}\, i}  P_{\rm max}{\rm (in)}_i - L_{ij}(s) . \label{pmax}
\end{eqnarray}
Equation (\ref{p1min}) states that the power of the minimum 1 emerging from
the {\it j}th output of the device will be the minimum over all possible
states of the minimum over all possible inputs having loss terms of the
minimum 1's arriving at those inputs minus the loss terms. Equation
(\ref{p0max}) states that the power of the maximum 0 emerging from the {\it
j}th output of the device will be the maximum over all possible states of
the sum of the inputs of ($P_{\rm max} $ minus the cross talk term) for
those inputs that have cross talk terms in that state, plus ($P_{0\rm max}
$ minus the loss term) for those inputs that have loss terms in the
particular state.  Equation (\ref{pmax}) states that $ P_{\rm max} $
emerging from the {\it j}th output of the device will be the maximum over
all the possible states of the sum over all the {\it i} inputs of $ P_{\rm
max} $ minus the loss or cross talk between each of those inputs and the
output {\it j}.  These equations are in representational format, as the
subtraction of the loss parameters implies logarithmic units for power; so
in practice the summations require conversion to linear units.  \ldots

The loss and cross talk terms $ L_{ij} $ are the edge weights mentioned
above.  Note that circuit heuristics are ignored because the extremes are
taken over all device states.  That is, the power triple is guaranteed to
be a bound on the worst case; but in a circuit, the worst case may not be
as poor as the triple owing to the exclusion of some combinations of states
and inputs.  Equation (\ref{p0max}) shows the most important reason for
tracking $P_{\rm max}$: the greatest power produces the largest possible
cross talk term in this model.  Thus $P_{\rm max}$ is essential for
calculating subsequent $ P_{0\rm max} $ terms.

As example system components, consider lithium niobate directional couplers
and passive 3-dB couplers as logic devices and optical fiber and 3-dB
splitters for interconnection.  Figure 3 shows a lithium niobate
directional coupler configured as a five-terminal optical device.\cite{6}
Of the three device inputs, a, b, and c, only the first two are
transmitting inputs; inputs that couple power directly to the outputs.
Input c, a detection point in our terminology, functions as a device
control.  As the logic equation shows, when sufficient power is applied to
c, the switch is placed in the bar state; otherwise it is in the cross
state.  The graph model on the right of the figure makes c into a detection
point that is independent of the two-state coupling between the other
inputs and outputs.  Figure 4 illustrates at a more functional level how
the transmission coupling occurs.


3-dB couplers and splitters are modeled as devices with two inputs and two
outputs, with 3-dB of loss from each input to each output, no cross talk, a
single device state, and no detection points.  Lossy interconnections, such
as optical fibers, are modeled as devices with one input, one output, a
single loss term, no cross talk, a single device state, and no detection
points.  There is no need to model loss-free interconnections, since they
add nothing to the analysis. However, if it is desired to model them for
clarity, or if a graphical system model already exists that contains them,
they may be modeled exactly like lossy interconnections, but with zero loss
and cross talk.

\subsection{ Modeling the System}
In this section we extend the applicability of the device graph model to
complete systems.  \ldots The problem of finding critical paths is
efficiently solvable with order ($n$) depth-first search (DFS)
algorithms.\cite{9} The power triples are calculated by scanning the
vertices in ascending order and applying Eqs.\ (\ref{p1min})--(\ref{pmax})
to each.  When the search algorithm detects that the conditions of Eq.
(\ref{p0}) are not met, it is desirable to know the critical path to the
detector so that the problem can be corrected. \ldots

\section{Discussion}
The technique described above is indispensable in designing complex optical
systems whose components have significant nonidealities.  It has been
incorporated into a digital optical computer-assisted design system,
HATCH,\cite{10} where it has proven invaluable in the design of optical
counters\cite{11,12} and an optical delay line memory system.\cite{13} It
is now being used in designing a bit-serial optical computer now under
construction in our laboratories.  \ldots

As we mentioned above, linear cross talk and loss behaviors are assumed in
the device models for computing the power triples.  If the transfer
functions of the devices are non-linear, then the three equations should be
modified to incorporate the appropriate transfer characteristics.
