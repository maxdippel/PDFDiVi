abstract	58	67	(1;[132.446030;267.597961;484.939758;377.605164])	We study the properties of the double-frequency sine-Gordon model in the vicinity of the Ising quantum phase transition displayed by this model. Using a mapping onto a generalised lattice quantum Ashkin-Teller model, we obtain critical and nearly-off-critical correlation functions of various operators. We discuss applications of the double-sine-Gordon model to one-dimensional physical systems, like spin chains in a staggered external field and interacting electrons in a staggered potential.

text	78	97	(1;[103.181084;109.417603;514.204712;135.921387]),(2;[103.181084;622.019348;514.204712;758.397278])	The problem of determining the asymptotic behaviour of a conformal field theory (CFT) under the action of a relevant operator is well studied and understood, also in view of its relation to the physics of many quantum one-dimensional (1D) and classical two-dimensional (2D) models. A less studied case concerns a CFT perturbed by two relevant operators. Namely, consider a CFT subjected to such relevant perturbation, [formula], with scaling dimension [formula], that turns it into a fully massive quantum field theory (QFT). Then add another relevant perturbation, [formula], which, if acting alone, would also make our QFT fully massive. Although this is not as common situation as the previous one, we will show that it displays interesting features which may be realized in physical systems.
text	99	124	(2;[103.181084;330.792816;514.204712;612.119873])	Without loss of generality, we assume that [formula], i.e. that the second perturbation is more relevant then the first one. Moreover, we shall require, for the time being, that the operator product expansion (OPE) of these two operators is closed in the sense that it does not produce other relevant operators. The most general case will be discussed in a separate section. Then, the nave expectation, which prevailed until recently, is that no qualitative changes occur in this case with respect to the standard situation of a CFT perturbed by a single relevant operator: the low-energy behaviour of the theory would be governed by the most relevant operator and, at any rate, the theory would remain fully massive. This expectation is however not a general rule if the two operators exclude each other, that is, if the field configurations which minimise one perturbation term do not minimise the other. In this case, the interplay between the two competing relevant operators can produce a novel quantum phase transition between two massive QFT's through a critical (massless) point. It is intuitively clear that such a scenario is only conceivable if the ratio of the bare coupling constants, [formula], is large enough.
text	126	131	(2;[103.181084;257.986206;514.204712;321.557556])	Recently Delfino and Mussardo (DM)[\cite=DM] considered the double-frequency sine-Gordon (DSG) model, which is a Gaussian model of a scalar field [formula], perturbed by two relevant vertex operators with the ratio of their scaling dimensions [formula]. The Hamiltonian density of the DSG model reads:

text	150	157	(3;[103.181084;658.422668;514.204712;757.733093])	The purpose of this paper is to investigate in detail the critical properties of this transition and to discuss physical applications to spin chains and other quantum one-dimensional (1D) systems. While we shall concentrate on the DSG model in what follows, it should be noted that the phenomenon is more general - similar quantum phase transitions do happen in more complicated models; those shall be addressed elsewhere [\cite=else].
text	159	168	(3;[103.181084;512.809387;514.204712;648.523193])	Apart from the practical interest in physical realizations of the DSG model, this problem is of relevance also from a pure theoretical point of view. Indeed, we have already mentioned that the Ising critical point separates two strong-coupling, massive phases; hence, by definition, its analytical description is outside the range of applicability of perturbation theory. In this paper we propose a nonperturbative scheme, which is essentially based on the mapping of the DSG model onto another equivalent model - a generalised quantum Ashkin-Teller model on a 1D lattice, where the Ising critical point becomes accessible.
text	170	188	(3;[103.181084;294.389526;514.204712;502.909912])	The paper is organised as follows. In section 2 we briefly discuss the DSG model at the semi-classical level and outline our approach to tackle the Ising criticality in the vicinity of the decoupling point [formula]. In sections 3-5 we present a complete description of the critical properties of the DSG model at the Ising transition. In section 3 we introduce a quantum lattice version of a generalised AT model which, apart from the conventional marginal inter-chain coupling, also includes a 'magnetic filed' type of interaction, [formula]. We show that, in the continuum limit, this model is equivalent to the DSG model at [formula]. In section 4 we employ a new ([formula]-[formula]) representation of the deformed AT model which enables us to correctly identify those degrees of freedom that become critical. In section 5 we use the results of the quantum-spin-chain mappings to determine the physical properties of the DSG model close to the criticality.
text	190	198	(3;[103.181084;185.179565;514.204712;284.489990])	In the next two sections we discuss applications of the DSG model to physical systems. In particular, we discuss Ising transitions in a spontaneously dimerized S=1/2 antiferromagnetic chain in a staggered magnetic field (section 6), and in the 1D Hubbard model with a staggered potential (section 7). In section 8 we show that at [formula] the second-order Ising transition may transform to a first-order one. Section 9 contains discussion of the results and conclusions.

text	209	213	(4;[103.181084;637.354919;514.204712;682.724609])	In this paper we will be dealing with the particular version of the DSG model ([\ref=HDSG]) corresponding to the case [formula]. We will also assume that [formula], although its sign is unimportant due to the obvious symmetry [formula].
text	215	239	(4;[103.181084;364.330048;514.204712;628.627991])	For [formula] the Gaussian model is perturbed by two relevant vertex operators closed under the OPE [\cite=DM]. The existence of the Ising phase transition can be qualitatively understood via a quasi-classical analysis: inspecting the profile of the potential [formula] as a function of the ratio [formula]. At [formula] one has a periodic potential of a single-frequency sine-Gordon (SG) model. For [formula] the period of the potential is doubled in such a way that in the region [formula] it can be viewed as a sequence of double-well potentials with the local structure [formula], where [formula]. Precisely at [formula] each local double-well potential transforms to a [formula] one [formula], and (in the Ginzburg-Landau sense) this is a signature of the Ising criticality with the central charge [formula]. It should be stressed that the double-well structure of the potential [formula] only occurs for [formula]. Hence the Ising critical point only exist for positive [formula]. The case of [formula] is qualitatively different: here the [formula]-perturbation removes the degeneracy between neighbouring minima of [formula] and thus leads to soliton confinement (similarly to the analysis in Ref[\cite=aff-conf]). The spectrum in this case always remains massive.
text	241	264	(4;[103.181084;109.506836;514.204712;355.094757]),(5;[103.181084;749.430908;192.926941;757.733093])	Thus, for model ([\ref=HDSG]) with [formula], a plausible scenario is that the relevant perturbations naturally act on the two constituent Ising models of the starting Gaussian model, leaving one of them massless on the critical line [formula]. (Quasi-classically [formula]. A better estimation which takes into account quantum fluctuations yields a power law [formula], where [formula]). Indeed, DM have argued that the Ising transition is a universal property of the DSG model ([\ref=HDSG]) as long as [formula]. This makes it possible to consider the vicinity of the point [formula] where the description of the transition greatly simplifies. Namely, it is well known[\cite=Coleman] [\cite=LE] that [formula] is the decoupling (or Luther-Emery) point of the ordinary SG model ([formula]), at which the latter is equivalent to a theory of free massive fermions. The scaling dimension 1/4 of the [formula]-term in ([\ref=HDSG]) indicates that this point is special for the DSG model as well, suggesting an Ising model interpretation. In this paper we shall be working in the vicinity of the decoupling point. Rescaling the field [formula], the DSG model can be written in an equivalent form:
formula	266	271	(4;[305.766418;79.529663;311.619415;87.234093]),(5;[172.952667;700.954712;514.204712;734.100403])	[formula]
text	272	289	(5;[103.181084;473.450714;514.204712;684.465088])	where [formula] and [formula]. It was originally noted by DM that this form of the DSG model can be related to a deformed 2D Ashkin-Teller (AT) model, which can be viewed as the standard AT model, i.e. a model of two marginally coupled 2D Ising models with order parameters [formula] and [formula], extended to include a magnetic field type coupling, [formula]. DM then argued that, in the strong-coupling limit ([formula]), the system effectively reduces to a single Ising model which may become critical if the temperature is properly tuned to its critical value. This argument can be extended to finite values of [formula], provided that the two Ising copies are originally in a disordered phase, and thus explains the existence of a critical line in the [formula]-[formula] plane ([formula]) along which the deformed AT model flows from the ultraviolet [formula] fixed point to the infrared [formula] Ising fixed point.
text	291	325	(5;[103.181084;109.417603;514.204712;463.551270])	We shall elaborate on the DM argument by explicitly constructing the mappings between the DSG model and various spin models, with the aim to fully describe the Ising transition and, in particular, calculate correlation functions of the operators in the original DSG model. The novel points of our analysis are as follows. First, we concentrate on quantum lattice spin chain models rather than on their classical counterparts (in the transfer matrix sense), as this formulation profits from the use of the powerful apparatus of various spin operator transformations like the duality transformation. Secondly, we identify the correct degrees of freedom in the deformed quantum AT model that become critical. Since the original Ising models enter symmetrically, this is a nontrivial step which is accomplished via a 'change of basis' transformation. Let us denote the critical degrees of freedom by [formula] and the remaining gaped degrees of freedom by [formula] (see the main text for precise definitions). The strategy to calculate the correlation functions is then to express the DSG-operators in terms of the lattice [formula] and [formula] operators. At the Ising transition [formula] and [formula] operators asymptotically decouple, with the [formula]-operators being critical and (some of) the [formula] operators acquiring finite average values. This allows us to trace the relation between the original DSG-operators and those from the operator content of the underlying critical Ising model, which ultimately accomplishes a complete description of the critical properties at the Ising transition.

This alternative route is traced in Appendix [\ref=Lattice-fermions].
text	554	566	(9;[103.181084;201.367126;514.204712;337.745117])	Turning to the DQAT model, we observe that the [formula]-term in ([\ref=DQAT]) is nonlocal in terms of lattice Majorana operators. However, it is known that, for two identical Ising models close to criticality, products of two Ising operators belonging to different chains, [formula], all with scaling dimension 1/4, can be expressed locally in terms of bosonic vertex operators with the same scaling dimension (see, for instance, [\cite=GNT] and references therein). In Appendix A.2, we rederive this correspondence starting from the lattice theory of two quantum Ising chains and paying special attention to the Klein factors:

The identification of the parameters is as follows: [formula], [formula], and [formula] (it is understood that when [formula], [formula], [formula] so as to keep the DSG parameters finite).
text	624	631	(10;[103.181084;230.750366;514.204712;314.881165])	The 2[formula]2 matrix form of [formula] reflects the symmetry of the DQAT model with respect to the interchange of the two constituent quantum chains, ([formula]), under which the DSG Hamiltonians [formula] transform to each other. Formally, this symmetry appears as "unphysical" because the Hamiltonian [formula] commutes with [formula]. This allows one to set

However, while [formula] is a conserved quantity, each [formula] is not, implying that correlations functions of operators which contain the Klein factors may involve transitions between the two different sectors [formula].
text	646	668	(11;[103.181084;512.809387;514.204712;757.733093])	We shall see below that some physical models are automatically mapped onto a single DSG model with a fixed sign of [formula] (section 5), while some others reduce to the matrix form ([\ref=matrixDGS]) (section 6). In the latter case, the effective [formula] symmetry corresponds to a physical discrete [formula] symmetry of the model in question, which is spontaneously broken in the ground state, a typical example of this kind being a spontaneously dimerized phase. In such situations, the Hamiltonians [formula], when considered separately, describe only excitations above each of the two degenerate vacua. On the other hand, the two-fold degeneracy of the ground state necessarily implies the existence of topological kinks which interpolate between neighbouring degenerate minima of two different potentials [formula], corresponding to [formula]. However, in the entire parameter space of the model ([\ref=matrixDGS]), including the Ising transition point, the sets of minima of the potentials [formula] always have a finite relative shift. This means that the topological [formula] kinks always remain massive and thus appear as irrelevant excitations as long as Ising criticality is concerned.
text	670	678	(11;[103.181084;421.801086;514.204712;502.909912])	Thus, when working with a single Hamiltonian [formula], all operators representing strongly fluctuating fields at the Ising critical point are automatically taken into account. All "off-diagonal" operators proportional to [formula] or [formula], such as those given by ([\ref=smu1]) and ([\ref=mus1]), can be dropped as they represent short-ranged fields at the critical point.

text	685	699	(11;[103.181084;154.697205;514.204712;327.478455])	The original two-chain representation of the Hamiltonian ([\ref=DQAT]) is not the most appropriate one to describe the role of the coupling term ([\ref=hterm]), but some general statements can already be drawn at this stage. First of all it is clear that, if the chains are originally in the ordered phase, the role of the [formula]-term would be exhausted by removing the degeneracy between the four ground states specified by the signs of the order parameters [formula] and [formula]. The lowest-energy sector, determined by the condition [formula], will stay massive anyway. (For two ordered Ising copies, the [formula]-term gives rise to an effective longitudinal magnetic field applied to both Ising systems and thus keeping them massive.) Therefore, new effects can be only expected if the two chains are originally disordered.

For the sake of clarity, let us make a duality transformation and replace the original model by a pair of two ordered Ising copies well below [formula], coupled by the interaction [formula]. Consider a single quantum Ising model ([\ref=QI]) at [formula]. In the leading approximation, its ground state is fully polarised. The disorder operator [formula] creates a domain wall by flipping all the spins within the interval [formula]. At short distances, the domain walls behave like hard-core bosons which, in the dilute limit, are equivalent to spinless fermions with the dispersion

The combinations of the creation and annihilation operators that appear in the coupling term reflect the fact that [formula]. It is clear that the model ([\ref=dilute-ham]) is a theory of four Majorana fermions, two of which are not affected by the coupling term.

In the dual representation, the above estimation of the critical field should be replaced by [formula]. Strictly speaking, the domain walls do not posses a fermionic statistics but contain a Jordan-Wigner type phase, which can only be neglected in the extreme dilute limit.

Although this simple picture holds only when [formula], if a universal behaviour is to be expected, then we are lead to conclude that, both at strong and weak [formula], the Ising transition essentially corresponds the situation when the [formula] degrees of freedom go massless, while the [formula] degrees of freedom remain frozen in a disordered configuration with both [formula] and [formula] nonzero. Notice that, with the above strong-coupling description, we are unable to determine the critical line and even estimate the strength of the irrelevant operators close to this line. This means that, even though the universal properties of the DSG model at the Ising transition, including the singular parts of physical quantities and critical exponents of the correlation functions, will be captured correctly, the nonuniversal parts, such as prefactors and subleading corrections to main asymptotics, are not to be trusted.

As soon as any of those parameters is shifted away from the criticality constraint, the system becomes off-critical. The corresponding perturbations to the critical Hamiltonian are therefore relevant operators with conformal dimensions determined by the universality class of the critical model. Notice that there is no magnetic field coupled to [formula] in the exact lattice Hamiltonian ([\ref=H-new-rep]). Therefore a departure from criticality by changing any one of the couplings ([formula], [formula], [formula], or [formula]) will give rise to an Ising mass term.

Fortunately, the status of the staggered magnetic field has recently changed from exotic to legitimate. It has been shown that, in some quasi-1D antiferromagnetic compounds, such field can be realized as an intrinsic one. An effective staggered field can originate from the Neel ordering of one magnetic sublattice and being experienced by loosely connected magnetic chains which form another sublattice and remain disordered down to very low temperatures [\cite=MZ]. A sign-alternating component of the magnetic field can be also effectively generated due to a staggered anisotropy of the gyromagnetic tensor, as it is the case for the Copper-Benzoate organic molecule [\cite=benzoate].

The main physical effect is the spinon-magnon transmutation: deconfined spinons of the frustrated Heisenberg chain, carrying the spin S = 1/2, form bound states with S = 0 and S = 1, the latter representing coherent triplet magnon excitations.

From the analysis of the preceding section we conclude that the spontaneously dimerized chain in a staggered magnetic field has two phases separated by a quantum critical point at [formula]. At [formula] a "mixed" phase is realized, with coexisting dimerization [formula] and staggered magnetization [formula]. Notice that, as opposed to the case of uniform magnetic field that couples to the (conserved) total magnetisation, the dependence [formula] shows no threshold in [formula]. Dimerization vanishes at the Ising critical point [formula] and remains zero in the "pure Neel" phase, [formula]. The critical field [formula] can be estimated by comparing the dimerization gap [formula] with the gap that would open up at [formula]: [formula] So the critical staggered field is exponentially small: [formula]

The latter circumstance allows one to identify the spin [formula] of elementary excitations as the topological quantum number of the kinks interpolating between the nearest degenerate minima of the potential [formula] in ([\ref=j1j2-DSG]). According to the structure of [formula], there will be "short" and "long" kinks, carrying the spin [formula] where [formula] smoothly increases from [formula] at [formula] to [formula] at [formula]. Therefore, in the mixed phase, the original massive S = 1/2 spinon splits into two topological excitations carrying fractional spins [formula]. These spins become [formula] and [formula] at the Ising transition, and it is just the singlet kink which loses its topological charge and becomes massless at [formula]. The existence of the fractional-spin excitations in the mixed phase [formula] is nothing but the spin version of the charge fractionization of topological excitations found earlier in 1D commensurate Peierls insulators with broken charge conjugation symmetry (e.g. cis-polyacetylene)[\cite=braz], and also in a recent study of a 1D Mott insulator with alternating single-site energy [\cite=FGN].

It is therefore instructive to compare the results for the dynamical magnetic susceptibility of the DSG model we have found via Ising-type mappings with those for the SG model with a [formula] operator only, which were obtained in the paper [\cite=ETD] by means of the form-factor technique. As for [formula] we enter the ordered phase ([formula]=0), the uniform susceptibility ([\ref=chiun],[\ref=Dorfin]) is of a coherent nature, very much in agreement with [\cite=ETD] ('magnon' contribution). The staggered susceptibility ([\ref=chiin],[\ref=chiout]), on the other hand, is incoherent in excellent agreement with the kink-antikink continuum observed in [\cite=ETD] (the breather contribution is missed in our approach; it might be recovered as a bound state of Majorana fermions, but we shall not push our analysis beyond this point). No analogous comparison can be made for [formula] (no form-factor calculations are, to our knowledge, currently available for the [formula] SG model, and, even if they were, a comparison would have been of dubious validity, as the addition of the [formula]-operator qualitatively changes the spectrum from the start).

In this section we shall consider a particular example of this kind which has been recently discussed in Ref.[\cite=FGN] - a 1D repulsive Hubbard model at 1/2-filling with a sign-alternating single-site energy (i.e. staggered chemical potential). The Hamiltonian of this model reads:
formula	1673	1677	(26;[302.839905;79.529663;314.545898;87.234093]),(27;[158.059052;693.315125;514.204712;717.181152])	[formula]

The model ([\ref=ham]) was originally proposed in the context of quasi-1D organic materials [\cite=nagaosa] and is also believed to be prototypical for ferroelectric perovskites [\cite=egami].
text	1686	1709	(27;[103.181084;327.837463;514.204712;609.828674])	In spite of its apparent simplicity, the model ([\ref=ham]) reveals nontrivial physics. At [formula] it describes a band insulator (BI) with a spectral gap for all excitations. At [formula], the low-energy spectrum of the BI is that of free massive Dirac fermions. When the Hubbard interaction is switched on, the finite fermionic mass [formula] makes the theory free of infrared divergences, so that the BI phase remains stable for small enough [formula]. On the other hand, at [formula], the Hamiltonian ([\ref=ham]) coincides with the standard (translationally invariant) Hubbard model which is exactly solvable [\cite=LW] and is well known to describe a Mott insulator (MI) at any positive value of [formula], if the electron concentration [formula] (the case of a 1/2-filled energy band). The MI state has a finite mass gap [formula] in the charge sector induced by commensurability of the electron density with the underlying lattice. At energies well below [formula], local charge fluctuations are suppressed, and the low-energy spin dynamics of the model coincides with that of the spin-1/2 Heisenberg antiferromagnetic chain, the latter possessing a gapless spectrum. At a finite [formula], the charge-gaped MI phase is stable against site alternation, provided that [formula] is small enough [\cite=nagaosa].

Starting out from the MI phase and decreasing [formula] at a fixed [formula], one has to identify the mechanism for the mass generation in the spin sector. On the other hand, it is clear that the charge degrees of freedom should also be involved in the BI-MI crossover. Indeed, dividing the lattice into two sublattices, A and B, with the single-site electron energies [formula] and [formula], respectively, and considering electronic states of a diatomic (AB) unit cell in the limit [formula], one finds a region [formula] where two charge configurations, [formula] and [formula], become almost degenerate. This is the so-called mixed-valence regime where those excitations responsible for the charge redistribution among the two unit-cell configurations become soft. This means that, apart from the spin transition, a charge transition associated with vanishing of the charge gap at some value of [formula] is also expected to occur.

Assuming that [formula], below we shall consider the effective low-energy field theory for the lattice model ([\ref=ham]).

Assuming that the charge gap is nonzero, we integrate out the massive charge degrees of freedom to obtain the effective action in the spin sector. According to the unbroken SU(2) symmetry of the model, the effective Hamiltonian in the spin sector retains its form ([\ref=spin]), but the current-current coupling constant undergoes an additive renormalization. In the second order in [formula] we obtain:

The spin sector now resembles the [formula] frustrated spin-1/2 chain (see section 5) with an effecive next-nearest-neighbour interaction [formula] generated by the staggered chemical potential [formula]. As long as [formula], the spin excitation spectrum remains gapless. However, decreasing [formula] at a fixed [formula] (or increasing [formula] at a fixed [formula]) eventually reverts the above inequality to [formula]. In this case the current-current perturbation becomes marginally relevant, and a continuous (BKT) transition takes place to a spontaneously dimerized insulating (SDI) phase with broken (site) parity and a finite mass gap in the spin sector.

This is easily understood by noticing that these two terms have the structure of two different fermionic mass bilinears, [formula] and [formula], with opposite transformation properties with respect to [formula] and [formula]. Thus, the parity properties of the SDI and BI phases are different, and this is a strong indication that the passage from SDI to BI should be associated with a significant redistribution of the charge density (charge transition).

Referring the reader to Ref.[\cite=FGN] where the mechanism of the charge transition is discussed in the context of excitonic instability of the BI phase, here we simply claim that for the model ([\ref=ham]), within the leading logarithmic accuracy, [formula], where the positive constant is of the order of unity.

The effective potential is given by:

It can be shown that, as long as the parameter [formula] is confined within the interval [formula], this potential, with all terms being strongly relevant perturbations, is indeed the most representative one for the model under discussion because no new relevant operators are generated in the course of renormalization. This is no longer true if [formula], the regime which can be realized for an extended model with extra finite-range interactions, e.g. [formula]. In this case, new relevant vertex operators will be generated upon renormalization, and the continuous Ising transition in the charge sector can transform to a first-order one. We will comment on that in the end of this section.

So the spin part of the spectrum in the SDI phase smoothly transforms to that of the BI phase. Therefore, being interested in the redistribution of the charge degrees of freedom in the vicinity of [formula], in ([\ref=U-eff]) we can replace [formula] by its vacuum expectation value, [formula]. The two signs here reflect the [formula] degeneracy of the dimerized ground state (spontaneously broken site parity; see Eq. ([\ref=g-PS])).

For instance, it is known that the critical line with non universal exponents separating the Charge Density Wave (CDW) and the Spin Density Wave (SDW) phases of the extended (U-V) Hubbard model, becomes a first order line at sufficiently strong coupling[\cite=Hirsh]. In fact, in the extended Hubbard model, the charge Luttinger liquid exponent [formula] can be lower than [formula], the point at which the second harmonics of the Umklapp scattering starts to be relevant. Therefore, at sufficiently strong interaction, it can indeed turn the CDW-SDW transition line into a first order one. A similar situation occurs with the charge transition in the electronic model, considered in section 7, when the latter is generalised to include a sufficiently strong nearest-neighbour repulsion [\cite=nagaosa].

text	2176	2189	(35;[103.181084;273.964539;514.204712;446.081665])	In this paper, we have proposed a nonperturbative description of the Ising criticality in the DSG model ([\ref=HDSG]). Using the equivalence between the DSG model and a deformed quantum Ashkin-Teller model, valid in the vicinity of the decoupling point, [formula], we were able to identify the effective Ising degrees of freedom that asymptotically decouple from the rest of the spectrum and become critical in the infrared limit. This identification allowed us to describe the UV-IR "transmutation" of all physical fields of the DSG model and calculate the correlation functions at and close to the transition. We have also demonstrated the efficiency of our approach to describe Ising transitions in some physical realizations of the DSG model.
text	2191	2200	(35;[103.181084;146.552917;514.204712;264.065063])	We believe that our quantum-Ising-chain approach can be generalised to the case when the number of the constituent Ising models, coupled by the interaction [formula], is larger than 2. Such situation can indeed be realized in certain SU(2)-invariant spin-ladders models which can be driven to criticality under the action of external staggered fields. In such systems, the quantum critical points may be not only of the Ising type but also correspond to SU(2)[formula] WZNW universality class. Such examples will be considered elsewhere [\cite={else}].

We notice that the parameter [formula] appears only in [formula] where it plays the role of an effective longitudinal field. Therefore the model ([\ref=mfa-tau]) is a quantum counterpart of a 2D Ising model in a nonzero external field which is known to be always noncritical.

The restriction ([\ref=restr-ising]) tells us that, for the Ising criticality to be reached at some critical value of [formula], the original disordered [formula] and [formula] chains should be far enough from their original critical point. In fact, as follows from ([\ref=restr-ising]), the value of the Majorana mass, when estimated as [formula], turns out to be of the order of the ultraviolet cutoff. This estimation reflects the already mentioned fact that the DM transition is indeed not a weak-coupling one from the standpoint of the DQAT model.
