abstract	26	39	(2;[122.135414;270.396362;488.116150;526.909241])	In this paper we study in detail different types of topological solitons which are possible in bilayer quantum Hall systems at filling fraction [formula] when spin degrees of freedom are included. Starting from a microscopic Hamiltonian we derive an effective energy functional for studying such excitations. The gauge invariance and [formula] character of this energy fuctional and their consequences are examined. Then we identify permissible classes of finite energy solutions which are topologically non-trivial. We also numerically evaulate a representative solution in which a pseudospin (layer degrees of freedom) bimeron in a given spin component is intertwined with spin-skyrmions in each layer , and and discuss whether it is energetically favoured as the lowest lying excitation in such system with some numerical results.

That such interesting possibilities can actually arise and play a significant role in the Quantum Hall physics was demonstrated in the work of of Sondhi et al Sondhi. They showed that for example , in a single layer Hall liquid at filling factor [formula], the lowest energy excitations in spin, for low Zeeman coupling are the so-called Skyrmions and not single spin flips. These Skyrmions are topological excitations in the spin texture, in which the spin starts being, say, "up" at the origin and as you go outwards, starts tilting down in a flared manner to become asymptotically "down" spin at large distances. Subsequently experimental support for the existence of such excitations was also discovered in NMR measurements [\cite=Barrett].

The double well Hall plateaux at unit filling can be understood by associating with each electron a "pseudospin" in addition to its lowest Landau level (LLL) orbital wavefunction [\cite=GirvMac], [\cite=Moon]. The up and down components of this pseudospinor give the probability amplitudes for the electron being in the upper and lower layer respectively. The ground state of the [formula] double layer system, known to be a quantum Hall state with a Hall conductivity plateaux is a pseudospin ferromagnet, with the pseudospin aligned in the x-direction. This is a very remarkable phenomenon in that it amounts to interlayer coherence between the electrons in the two layers. This pseudospin degree of freedom is in addition to physical spin. To start with, in analysing double layer phenomena, the spin degrees of freedom are suppresed for simplicity. Even then one can still consider excitations in the pseudospin. Inspired by the presence of Skyrmions in spin, people have also considered the possibility of topological excitations in pseudospin. Such pseudospin textures called "merons" and "bimerons" have been suggested as possible low lying excitations of double layer systems [\cite=GirvMac]. The homotopy group [formula] and its winding number are identical for spin and pseudospin since mathematically pseudospin is identical to spin, both being SU(2) spinor fields on a plane. The change in terminology from Skyrmions to bimerons does not indicate any topological difference between the two in going from spin to pseudospin excitations but only differences in their detailed profiles. This difference in turn happens because of the difference in the energetics of spin and pseudospin and correspondingly , their asymptotic direction. Meron excitations , if present in double layers, can give rise to a Kosterlitz-Thouless (KT) [\cite=KT] transition which may be enable them also to be experimentally observable.

That is the theme of this present work. We will continue to study the unit filling factor ([formula] case. There has already been some discussion of the combined spin-pseudospin [formula] double layer system [\cite=Arov], [\cite=Ezawa]. Our work discusses diferent aspects of the problem than these studies. We analyse in substantive detail intertwined spin-pseudospin topological excitations of this system . When both spin and pseudospin are active degrees of freedom , these are together described by a 4-component object. This 4-component object has been referred to as a [formula] spinor in the literature [\cite=Ezawa]. That is correct, but needs to be justified. A theory does not become a [formula] theory just because its field is a normalised 4-component object. The system must enjoy a U(1) gauge invariance, which is what makes the spinors span a projective space, implied in the acronym CP. Without that gauge invariance the beautiful results on [formula] in the literature [\cite=CP], [\cite=Raj] cannot be borrowed.
text	118	132	(4;[71.999992;210.047302;538.251587;433.519958])	So we begin in sec. II by showing, starting from the basic microscopic theory of the [formula] system that in the effective LLL theory for the spin-pseudospin texture such gauge invariance [formula] there. This is a straightforward derivation following the procedure developed by Moon et al [\cite=Moon]. In fact we find that in the limit where the layer-separation [formula] vanishes, the Coulomb interaction energy is precisely the protoype [formula] Euclidean action used in the pioneering papers on that topic [\cite=CP], for which exact topological solutions are known in terms of analytic functions. Of course, when [formula], the energy functional is more complicated and these analytical solutions do not hold. But the theory is still a [formula] theory, and the homotopy classification of the solutions still holds. Only the solutions themselves have to be calculated numerically.
text	134	150	(4;[71.999992;114.416016;538.251587;194.441650]),(5;[71.999992;616.480408;538.251587;768.229553])	A topologically non-trivial [formula] solution will generally involve an intertwined texture in the physical spin in each layer as well as in the pseudospin of each physical spin projection. One can ask whether such solutions can be legitimately interpreted as containing, as subsystems, spin-Skyrmions in either or both of the layers, possibly intertwined with a pseudospin meron or bimeron . If so, then such possibilities of containing several topological entities as subsystems has to be made compatible with the fact that any finite energy [formula] texture carries altogether [formula] topological winding number. We study all these questions in sec.III and find that there are certain restrictions on the types of solutions permitted. We show that the individual layers of a double layer system cannot accomodate all possible spin structures one may find in a pair of unrelated single layers. The spin winding numbers in the two layers are related to one another and to the pseudospin winding number.
text	152	164	(5;[71.999992;401.309937;538.251587;600.874756])	Consistent with these restrictions, we then pick in sec IV a representative ansatz which can be viewed as a spin-Skyrmion intertwined with a pseudospin bimeron. We then numerically evaluate such a solution by solving the coupled nonlinear partial differential equations that arise from extremising the texture energy functional. In earlier work [\cite=Ghosh1],[\cite=Ghosh2] we had studied in some detail both meron and bimeron excitations in pseudospin for double layer systems, with the spin degree of freedom suppresed. The present calculation is a more complicated version with [formula] spinors, but is done by similar numerical techniques. We present the spin and pseudospin proflies of our intertwined solutions for different values of interlayer separation.
text	166	178	(5;[71.999992;210.047302;538.251587;385.704315])	We also estimate the interaction energy of these solutions for some typical sets of values of system parameters. We discuss the dependence of this energy on the separation between the two meron centers. We find , as expected, that if only the gradient and capacitance energies are considered ,their minimisation will drive the textures towards zero size. Therefore we also calculate the topological charge dependent Coulomb energy of our solutions which, being repulsive , should drive the merons farther apart, offsetting the above tendency towards zero size. Then we extremise the total energy so obtained and find that it does show a minimum at some optimal meron separation, for each value of layer separation.
text	180	185	(5;[71.999992;114.416016;538.251587;194.441650])	We also find that these energies are approximately of the same order as those of purely spin Skyrmions of the single layer system. We make qualitative speculations on whether or not our spin-pseudospin intertwined solitons can be energetically favoured over solitons purely in spin or pseadospin, or over simple spin-flips.

text	188	193	(6;[71.999992;650.122864;538.251587;730.148499])	In a double layer quantum Hall system with both spin and pseudospin degrees of freedom present, an electron will carry, apart from its coordinate wavefunction [formula], a 4-component normalised spinor whose components in general may vary with the orbital quantum number [formula]. For any given [formula], this spinor can be denoted by
formula	195	200	(6;[233.674118;552.359497;538.251587;634.846863])	[formula]
text	201	226	(6;[71.999992;171.288757;538.251587;538.208374])	where the spin-pseudospin index [formula] corresponds to amplitudes that the electron is in the upper-layer up-spin, upper-layer down- spin, lower layer up-spin and lower -layer down-spin states respectively. It will henceforth be understood that the spinor is normalised, i.e.[formula] for each [formula] In the literature, this [formula] has sometimes been referred to as a [formula] spinor (see for instance Ezawa [\cite=Ezawa]). That is correct, but requires a little justification. In a [formula] theory, the spinor must not only be normalised 4-component object, but be defined only modulo a local gauge transformation common to all four components. This in turn requires that the Euclidean action or static energy functional of the spinor field enjoy a corresponding gauge invariance. In this section we will verify all this. We will also see that the nature of the gauge symmetry is different for a double layer system than for a pair of isolated single layers. This, as we shall see, has the important consequence of certain topological spin excitations in the double layer system which would have been present in the individual layers had they been far apart. In this way, along with establishing the [formula] nature of the system we will also identify permissible types of excitations where the spin and pseudospin are nontrivially intertwined, some of which we numerically evaluate in later sections.

This is just a straightforward generalisation of the procedure already in the literature for the simpler case of a spinless bilayer problem [\cite=Moon]. Therefore we need to present only the essential equations needed for completeness and understandability. We take the microscopic Hamiltonian to be

In the high-B limit each Landau gauge orbital density is uniform along the y-axis with support on a thin line localised around some value of x. Further these states are closely spaced along the x-direction. Using this feature, we will later on replace the orbital label [formula] by the x-coordinate itself. In that case the above texture [formula] depends only on the x-coordinate and not on y, and therefore carries zero topological number density (see eq.( 3.14) below). Nevertheless we will use this ansatz to calculate its energy functional, and then later that energy functional to the more general and topologically non-trivial textures by invoking isotropy of the system in the x-y plane. This was the exactly the strategy used in ref([\cite=Moon]). We will calculate the energy functional of the spin-pseudospin texture (2.8) by taking the mean value of the second quantised Hamiltonian in that state .

This is a [formula] transformation. These phases can also vary with the orbital index [formula]. Note : [formula] is not the space coordinate. But, following accepted approximations (see ref [\cite=Moon]) eventually the sum over the orbital index [formula] will be converted into an integral over space coordinate, invoking the fact that for large magnetic fields, each LLL orbital wavefunction is highly localised. Hence the above [formula] dependent transformation corresponds to spatially local gauge transformations.

Then each can have its own 2-component spin texture described by a [formula] system (equivalent to a non-linear O(3) sigma model) with its own U(1) gauge symmetry (see [\cite=GirvMac] and [\cite=Raj]). The well separated pair of layers should enjoy [formula] gauge symmetry. Our derivation shows a similar effect. When [formula], both the tunnelling parameter [formula] in ([\ref=1body]) and the interlayer Coulomb potential [formula] involved in ([\ref=ex]) would vanish and the full [formula] gauge invariance would indeed be restored. We will see later that this reduced gauge symmetry of a double-layer system at finite separation has consequences in terms of what types of finite energy excitations are permitted in it as compared to a pair of isolated single layers.

The ground state will correspond to a spatially uniform texture, and so can be obtained by minimising the gradient-free terms in [\ref=INTE]. This is acheived by the spinor [formula]. The one-body Zeeman and tunnelling energies are clearly minimised by this choice since the spin is polarised "down" in both layers and the psuedospin is along the x-direction, i.e. a layer-symmetric state. This choice also minimises the capacitance energy since it has equal occupancy in the two layers [formula].

The important point is that all four components of [formula] have the asymptotic phase [formula] which may depend on the spatial angle [formula]. The underlying reason is that the system is invariant under the same single U(1) gauge transformation [\ref=GT] acting on all the four components of [formula]. Finally, the phase function [formula] as [formula] is a mapping of one circle (spatial infinity) into another (the U(1) group manifold), and can therefore be divided into homotopy classes characterised by a winding number

Such a texture is forbidden as per our analysis and indeed if one calculates its energy by inserting it in [\ref=INTE] one will find the energy diverging logarithmically. The divergence comes from the angular derivative of [formula] contained in the Laplacians [formula] in [\ref=INTE]. That yields a contribution to the energy density proportional to

At the theoretical level the reason for this can be traced to the reduction of gauge symmetry discussed earlier, from [formula] to [formula] when two layers are together.

This is therefore a permitted (energetically finite) [formula] configuration with winding number [formula].
text	648	667	(16;[71.999992;377.402130;538.251587;648.690430])	One can see that this example is so designed that within each layer the spin texture looks like that of a single Skyrmion, while at the same time it is also a "bimeron" in the "psuedospin of the down-spin component" (contained in the second and fourth components of the 4-spinor of [\ref=exact]. See ref ([\cite=Ghosh2]) for more on bimerons.) But, we should remember that the the upper and lower layers are not separately normalised in the example [\ref=exact]. As [formula] varies so does the relative charge density in the two layers. Thus the spin vector in the upper (or lower) layer in [\ref=exact] will not be a unit vector at every point unless it is is locally renormalised by the charge density of that layer at that point. Similarly, while the pseudospin of the down-spin component in the example [\ref=exact] forms a bimeron, this pseudospin will also be a unit vector at each [formula] only after being renormalised by the down-spin density, which varies from point to point. Such renormalisation can be achieved by writing any general [formula] 4-spinor ([\ref=spinor]) in terms of spin and pseudospin polar angles.

(Recall that [formula] spinor has 6 real gauge invariant degrees of freedom. ) Suppose we tentatively define, using these polar angles the familiar expression for the spin-Skyrmion number in each layer by

Thus the example [\ref=exact] illustrates an intertwined spin- pseudospin topological configuration, containing the spin texture of a Skyrmion in each layer and the pseudospin texture of a bimeron in the down-spin component.

([\ref=Q]). Although the above example ([\ref=exact]) contains the texture of two Skyrmions and a bimeron, its [formula] topological index [formula] obtained by inserting it into eq. ([\ref=Q]) will come out to be not 3 , but unity. The separate sub-charges for spin and pseudospin defined in ([\ref=Qs]) and ([\ref=Qpseudo]) in general do not have the same sanctity as they would have had for Skyrmions in a single layer or bimeron in a spinless problem. Although in the above example these separate spin and pseudospin winding numbers turn out to be integers, in general they need be integers , or more importantly , be conserved in time. They are not protected by homotopy considerations in our full 4-component theory. The angles [formula] etc used in [\ref=angles] cannot always be obtained from the original components [formula] of the 4-spinor [\ref=spinor] , since they are not defined at those singular points where [formula] respectively. A similar remark holds for the other angles used above. The numbers [formula] and [formula] can change in time due to leakages through such singular points . It is however interesting to note that the exact [formula] winding number can be rewritten in expanded form using the angles defined in [\ref=angles] into parts that can be attributed to winding of spin and pseudospins. This also brings out the intertwining of spin - psedospin texture . We have,

But, for our full theory in the presence of a non-zero layer separation and with Zeeman and tunnelling energies , classical solutions minimise the full energy functional [\ref=INTE], have to be obtained numerically by solving the non-linear coupled partial differential equations that the minimisation conditions yield. The simple analytical example [\ref=exact] however will guide us in setting up the desired ansatz for the numerical solution with appropriate boundary conditions so that intertwined textures which are nontrivially wound in both spin and pseudospin can be obtained for our full theory. An illustrative family of such solutions is obtained in the next section.

However here the advantages of introducing such an unfamiliar co-ordinate system is not as much as in the simple spinless bilayer problem of [\cite=Ghosh2] because the ansatz here is not symmetric between the two layers. Consequently unlike the spinless case [formula] is no more antisymmetric about [formula] = 0 axis. All these features along with the fact that the energy minimisation unavoidably requires solving coupled non-linear partial diffential equations ( p.d.e.) render the numerical exercise much more complicated here . What we have done under these circumstances is the following.

The terms in each equation with the coefficient [formula], which accounts for the anisotropy in the exchange energy is not included in the process of numerical integration. As a justification of such simplification we can say that the anisotropic terms which involve higher order gradients of the spin pseudospin field will have less pronounced effect compared to the capacitance term on the solutions. This has been graphically shown in Fig. 1 and 2 of our earlier work [\cite=Ghosh2]. Even after this drastic simplification we are still left with solving four coupled non-linear p.d.e's . For example, the equation which is obtained by extremising the energy w.r.t [formula] is

Similarly we wil have three more equations obtained by extremising the energy functional with respect to [formula] and then writing the resulting equations in bipolar co-ordinates. We will not display them here.

Here also one can see that the Jacobian factor [formula] in the first term of the eq. [\ref=calpha] is singular at the point [formula]. The behaviour of [formula] near this point is also going to be same as the behaviour of [formula] in ref. ([\cite=Ghosh2]). The major difference compared to the earlier problem however comes from the fact that it is no longer sufficient to find out the solutions in one quadrant and get the rest from symmetry considerations. We have to solve this problem on both side of the [formula] axis since our starting ansatz solution is not completely antisymmetric around [formula]. During the numerical work one also has to be careful about the different branches of the angles [formula]. As one needs to integrate the equations on the both sides of the [formula] axis the size of the mesh on which we have to discretise the field equations becomes larger compared to the earlier case of spin-frozen double layer problem [\cite=Ghosh2]. Also here we have to solve four coupled p.d.e's simultaneously. This simultaneous increase in the number of lattice points as well as independent fields demands that we have to invert a huge determinant in the Newton-Raphson procedure [\cite=numer] while improving over the initial guess solution. This forces us to increase the lattice constants of the mesh slightly compared to what we have done in our earlier work [\cite=Ghosh2]. However we have checked that the error introduced in this way is not very high. In the next subsection we shall present our results along with the discussion.

text	968	991	(22;[71.999992;173.196838;538.251587;492.964996])	Our solutions of eq.([\ref=calpha]) along with the other three field equations yield the spatial behaviour of the [formula] fields parametrised in term of the angles [formula] , [formula] ,[formula] and [formula]. The calculations are done iteratively. We start with the simple analytical spinor [\ref=sub] which is the exact solution when the capacitance and anisotropy terms in the energy ([\ref=Evar])are absent. Then the capacitance term in the equation is introduced in small steps and the corresponding solution obtained numerically. We have performed several calculations each starting from different initial values of the constants [formula] and b . The constant [formula] represents the starting value of the first component of the spinor in the iteration process. It stands for the spin-Skyrmion size in the [formula] limit, but when subsequent iterations are performed in the presence of other energy terms, it is replaced by a space dependent solution. But the parameter [formula] is fixed for a given calculational run. It represents the meron separation and enters into the equation ([\ref=calpha]) explicitly through the first (capacitance) term. While we do calculations for different values of [formula], the optimal value of [formula] will have to be obtained by minimising the energy with repsect to it. We will return to this point later.

The major feature we want our numerical solution to have is the intertwining of the spin skyrmion with the pseudopsin bimeron . We would also like to show the leakage of electrons of either spin from one layer to another as we move in space, as a fallout of this intertwining. To show this , we have plotted both [formula] as well as [formula] as a function of [formula] for a set of values of the angle [formula] in Fig.1 and Fig. 2 respectively. These solutions correspond to layer separation [formula] , bimeron center-separation [formula] and starts from an initial value of [formula] in the starting trial solution [\ref=sub]. The sequence of curves shown correspond to [formula] equal to 0.09[formula], 0.36[formula], 0.63[formula], and 0.90[formula] respectively with the outermost one belonging to [formula] equal to 0.09[formula]. As we have discussed earlier [\cite=Ghosh2], Note from the definition of the bipolar coordintaes that spatial infinity in x-y plane corresponds to [formula] and [formula] both equal to zero. As we approach this point in the [formula] plane, the solution should damp exponentially as [formula] where
formula	1016	1016	(23;[262.722687;495.677490;538.251587;524.988220])	[formula]
text	1017	1021	(23;[71.999992;449.125610;538.251587;481.335632])	. Correspondingly we see in Fig. 1 and 2 that the low [formula] curves rise very slowly as [formula] increases away from zero.
text	1023	1042	(23;[71.999992;138.323853;538.251587;433.519958])	The interesting point to note about these solutions is that in Fig. 1 [formula] approaches different (absolute) asymptotic values as [formula] approaches [formula].(These are respectively the centers of the two merons that form the bimeron. Although computational limitations allow us to go only upto values 0f [formula], it is clear from the figure that asymptotic behavior has been obtained ). This asymptotic behaviour is extracted directly from the analytic ansatz [\ref=sub] and implies the leakage from the pseudospin to spin. It is useful to remember at this point that we have a bimeron only in the "pseudospin of the down-spin componenet" whereas [formula] represent the z-component of the total pseudospin. This is realised in Fig. 2. Here [formula] represent the z-componenet of the "pseudospin of the down-spin component". It is completely antisymmetric about [formula] and approaches [formula] as [formula] approaches [formula]. This behaviour is same as the behaviour of [formula] in the spinless bilayer case. This is how we can extract from our results the pure bimeron by suitably partitioning the pseudospin into different spin components.
text	1044	1061	(23;[71.999992;114.416016;538.251587;122.718193]),(24;[71.999992;544.756958;538.251587;768.229553])	Since bipolar co-ordinates are not very familiar we have given an alternate representation of the above results through a vector-plot in the physical x-y space in Fig. 3 and 4. The values of the parameters in these figures are same as those in Fig.1. In Fig. 3 the magnitude of each arrow gives the absolute value of the transvere component of the total pseudospin [formula] and it's angle with the x-axis gives [formula]. One should note in this regard the [formula] in the other parametrisation Here also one can see the length of the arrow does not quite vanish in one of the bimeron centres and makes this construction singular at this point. However when we look at the Fig. 4. where the magnitude of each arrow is [formula] and the angle is again [formula] , the magnitude of the arrow vanishes at each bimeron centre and the profile is no more singular. This makes Fig. 4 identical to the vector plot of the bimeron pseudopsin in the pure layer case Brey, [\cite=Ghosh2].
text	1063	1072	(24;[71.999992;401.309937;538.251587;529.151306])	In Fig 5.we have given a similar vector plot for the spin skyrmion in the upper layer. Here the length of the each arrow corresponds to the planar projection of the spin in the upper layer ([formula]) and the its direction gives the azimuthal angle ([formula]) of the projected vector .This picture very clearly points out how the skyrmion winds in the azimutahl plane about it's centre at [formula] Here also the layer separation [formula] and the starting values of [formula] and [formula] are the same as those in Fig. 1 . This set of parameters represents a typical example.
text	1074	1098	(24;[71.999992;114.416016;538.251587;385.704315]),(25;[71.999992;664.296082;538.251587;768.229553])	Lastly, we have evaluated the energy of these solutions for a set of values of the meron separation parameter [formula] .The optimal value of [formula] should be obtained by minimising the full energy as a function of [formula]. But if we include only the capacitance term and the (pseudo)spin-stiffness gradient terms in our energy, these will not lead to a non zero [formula], i.e the textures will want to shrink to zero size. The reason is that under rescaling, the capacitance term grows proportional to the square of the scale while the gradient terms are scale invariant. Of course a change in [formula] will not result in just an overall rescaling of the solution. The shape of the solution will also change since [formula] occurs as a constant multiplying the capacitance term in the differential equation (4.5). As a result, the [formula] dependence of the gradient and capacitance terms will not be simple, although qualitatively it should still drive the meron separation to zero size. This can be seen in Table 1, where we show these energies for ten different values of [formula] for a fixed value of other parameters. As expected the sum of both these energy contributions decreases strongly with decreasing [formula], thus driving the texture to zero-size. In reality however, these two terms are just the first two terms in the gradient expansion of the full energy functional. Higher order terms in the gradient expansion, if included, will make our nonlinear differential equation even more difficult to solve, but they can offset this tendency to shrink.
text	1100	1102	(25;[71.999992;592.572571;538.251587;648.690430])	In particular, one prominent higher gradient contribution to the energy is the Coulomb interaction between different portions of the topological charge densities. It is given by (see[\cite=Arov]) :
formula	1103	1105	(25;[192.110397;548.510193;538.251587;572.502991])	[formula]
text	1106	1107	(25;[71.999992;496.941254;538.251587;529.815491])	where [formula] is the [formula] topological charge density given by the integrand of the r.h.s of the equation ([\ref=Q]).
text	1109	1123	(25;[71.999992;281.770813;538.251587;481.335632])	Inclusion of the contribution of this term into our differential equation for the texture will introduce a [formula] nonlinear term, which will make it very difficult for us to solve it numerically. We can however make the following estimate. We can insert our texture solution , obtained without the Coulomb term , into the Coulomb energy integral and evaluate it as a function of [formula]. This contribution is also shown in the Table 1. As expected, the coulomb repulsion energy [formula] decreases with increasing [formula]. This term would like to keep the merons farther apart, and offset the tendency to shrink because of the other terms. Thus one may hope to get an optimal bimeron separation at which the sum of all these three energy contributions will get minimised as a function of [formula].
text	1125	1128	(25;[71.999992;186.139465;538.251587;266.165161])	In Table 1 we have presented our calculation for the layer separation [formula] where different contributions to the total energy are shown along with the their sum, the "total energy". For this particular layer separation a distinct minimum is obtained around [formula].
text	1130	1139	(25;[71.999992;114.416016;538.251587;170.533875]),(26;[71.999992;712.111694;538.251587;768.229553])	To see whether this behaviour is common to other layer separations we have plotted in fig.6 the total energy [formula] as a fuction of bimeron separation [formula] for a set of layer separations. The three sets of points in this figure corespond to three different layer separations, namely [formula] equal to [formula], [formula] and [formula]. All these three curves show distict minima for the total energy as a function of bimeron separation. We have also provided in Table 2 the size ([formula]) and total energy of the optimal bimeron for five values of layer separation.
text	1141	1157	(26;[71.999992;496.941254;538.251587;696.506104])	Notice from Table 2 that the optimal meron separation [formula] decreases with the increase of layer separation [formula] . For [formula] the optimal separation is around [formula] and gradually increases to [formula] for [formula] . For the case of pure layer bimeron Brey et. al. also found ([\cite=Brey]) a similar behaviour. This behavior could be attributed to the following. By lowering the layer separation (decreasing the [formula] ratio) one increases the relative importance of Coulomb repulsion among topological charge densities (coming from the intra-layer Coulomb energy) to the Capacitance term (coming from the interlayer Coulomb repusion). Hence the balancing of the capacitance term by the Coulomb energy will take place at a larger bimeron separation, thereby increasing the size of the bimeron.
text	1159	1166	(26;[71.999992;377.402130;538.251587;481.335632])	We found that resulting energy of these solitons at their optimal sizes varies very little as one changes the layer separation. Although bimerons of larger size at lower layer separations cost higher capacitance energy , the decrease in the Coulomb energy seems to fully offset that. As a result the total energy remains almost the same for different layer separations in the range [formula] to [formula] that we have studied.
text	1168	1196	(26;[71.999992;114.416016;538.251587;361.796509]),(27;[71.999992;638.529602;538.251587;769.890015])	An important question is whether our spin-pseudospin intertwined solution has a lower energy than other candidates among the low-lying excitations. Prominent among these other low lying excitations with whom such comparisons have to be done are (i) the particle-hole excitations and (ii) purely spin or pseudospin textured solitons. To start with note that in the minimal prototype [formula] system (valid in the [formula] limit ; see [\ref=proto]) the energy is just equal to [formula] (see ref. ([\cite=Raj]). Now , a pure-spin skyrmion in, say, one of the layers can also be written in our [formula] 4-spinor notation and will have a [formula] topological number [formula]. So will a bimeron in pseudospin of some spin component. Therefore in the prototype [formula] system our spin-pseudospin intertwined soliton with [formula] will have the same energy as a purely spin or pseudospin textured soliton with [formula]. The intertwining will not cost more energy. All these energies which are equal, are a quarter of that of a particle-hole pair (see ([\cite=Arov]) which costs an energy of [formula] in units of [formula] . However the difference in the energies of these various types of topological excitations come from the additional terms in the full energy [formula] due to capacitance , anisotropy and Coulomb repulsion. As we can see from the Table 2 that our intertwined soliton over a range of layer separation has energy around .60 [formula]. It is encouraging that a pair of these excitations would have somewhat lower energy than the particle-hole pair energy of 1.25.
text	1198	1208	(27;[71.999992;471.174805;538.251587;622.923950])	Of course our computational accuracy is not very high, given that we are limited in how many lattice points we can use. One must also improve on the results by solving for the texture functions and their energy after including single particle terms due to the Zeeman coupling and tunelling . Examples of such calculations can be found in the case of [formula] by Pardes et. al. [\cite=Pard] , but not for [formula] yet to date. Meanwhile, our result for the intertwined soliton at [formula] and its energy at best raise hopes that they may be competetive as candidates for low lying excitations in double layer systems with spin.
