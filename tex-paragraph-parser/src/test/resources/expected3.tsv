abstract	34	50	(1;[108.634750;583.588623;507.459900;686.452942])	We study effective-medium approximations for linear composite media by means of a path integral formalism with replicas. We show how to recover the Bruggeman and Hori-Yonezawa effective-medium formulas. Using a replica-coupling ansatz, these formulas are extended into new ones which have the same percolation thresholds as that of the Bethe lattice and Potts model of percolation, and critical exponents [formula] and [formula] in any space dimension [formula]. Like the Bruggeman and Hori-Yonezawa formulas, the new formulas are exact to second order in the weak-contrast and dilute limits. The dimensional range of validity of the four effective-medium formulas is discussed, and it is argued that the new ones are of better relevance than the classical ones in dimensions [formula] for systems obeying the Nodes-Links-Blobs picture, such as random-resistor networks.

text	57	92	(1;[54.000000;258.615906;562.094666;473.255463])	Among various effective-medium formulas used to model the effective behavior of random conducting linear composites, the symmetrical Bruggeman formula [\cite=BRUG35] [\cite=LAND52] is undoubtly the most popular. Applied to an insulator/conductor binary mixture, it predicts a percolation-like transition [\cite=KIRK71] [\cite=CLER90] [\cite=STAU92] [\cite=SAHI98] for a volumic fraction of conductor [formula], where [formula] is the space dimension. The critical exponents are [formula], and its critical properties are thoroughly discussed in Ref.[\cite=CLER90]. This formula can be interpreted in two ways. On one hand, Milton has shown [\cite=MILT85] that it yields the exact effective conductivity of an ad hoc ideal medium built with a particular hierarchical structure. On the other hand, the Bruggeman formula can be seen as a first (one-body) self-consistent approximation to general disordered symmetric cell-materials [\cite=MILL69], to which systematic corrections could be worked out. However, the Bruggeman approximation is very different from a mean-field theory of random conducting media. Indeed, an exact mean-field calculation on the Bethe lattice [\cite=STIN73] [\cite=STRA74] predicts a percolation threshold [formula] and exponents [formula] and [formula]. These exponents are exact for [formula], as well as the asymptotic behavior of the threshold when [formula] (at least, for the hypercubic lattice [\cite=STAU92] to which a continuum theory naturally compares [\cite=NOTE1]). These values are also obtained in a more systematic mean-field theory for random resistor networks [\cite=STEP77]. The remarkable discrepancy between the mean-field results and Bruggeman's formula indicates the ambiguous status of the Bruggeman theory. As a matter of fact, in spite of various (mostly perturbative) investigations [\cite=HORI75] [\cite=BERG81] [\cite=LUCK91] in order to precise its theoretical status, the reasons for the peculiar critical behavior of Bruggeman's formula are not completely cleared up. More surprisingly, another self-consistent effective-medium approximation [\cite=HORI75] [\cite=HORI77] due to Hori and Yonezawa (HY), obtained for the same type of media by means of a completely different approximation scheme (and later derived by functional methods [\cite=BART93]), exhibits the same exponents [formula] and a similar threshold behavior [formula].
text	94	114	(1;[54.000000;134.082886;562.094666;255.571762])	Apart from phenomelogical variants, and up to our knowledge, the Bruggeman and HY effective-medium formulas are the only ones obtained from the equations of electrostatics in continuous media which are able to describe, at least qualitatively, the overall features of a percolation transition in any dimension. One intriguing question concerns the possibility of deriving alternative effective-medium formulas from a continuum formulation, which do not lead to the seemingly unavoidable values [formula] and [formula]. As we show in this paper, such a possibility exists. Our starting point is the path integral approach recently put forward by Barthélémy and Orland[\cite=BART98], where the effective-medium problem is recast in a functional form. The problem reduces to compute a free-energy: roughly, the logarithm, averaged over the disorder, of a functional integral of Boltzmann-like weights, over allowed field configurations (which include boundary conditions). The average of the logarithm is carried out with the replica method (already used in Ref.[\cite=STEP77]). In Ref.[\cite=BART98], the authors showed that the path integral formulation allows one to easily recover the second-order weak-disorder expansion of the effective permittivity of nonlinear composites [\cite=BLUM91].
text	116	145	(2;[54.000000;642.368225;562.094666;786.771179])	However, this formulation has not yet been used to derive self-consistent estimates. In this paper, we show how this can be done. After a presentation of the functional approach to the homogeneization problem, and of the replica method (Sec.[\ref=pifotp]), we discuss self-consistent effective-medium approximations (Sec.[\ref=posa]). As usual in such approximations, a background reference medium is introduced under the form of an ansatz for the energy of the system, whose parameters are to be determined self-consistently (Sec.[\ref=o]). The new feature here is that the ansatz contains a replica-coupling term, whose significance is explained (Sec.[\ref=rcacota]). The self-consistency conditions to determine its parameters are next discussed, and two types of effective-medium formulas are identified (Sec.[\ref=sc]): one in which the replica couplings are cancelled (hereafter referred to as "type 1"), and the other one with non-zero replica couplings ("type 2"). Two different approximations are then worked out for each type (Sec.[\ref=tm]). It is found that type 1 generates the Bruggeman and HY formulas, whereas type 2 brings in two new effective-medium formulas which are "replica coupling counterparts" of the previous ones. They possess exponents [formula], [formula], and a threshold [formula] (Sec.[\ref=nef]). These new formulas are discussed in Sec.[\ref=d], where numerical results are presented before we conclude in Sec.[\ref=c].

text	149	153	(2;[54.000000;571.918335;562.094666;590.293884])	The effective properties of a random conducting medium can be defined with the help of the total dissipated power in the medium[\cite=WILL86] [\cite=SANC87] [\cite=PONT92b]. In terms of the electric field [formula], the dissipated power [formula] in the system of volume [formula] reads

text	159	163	(2;[54.000000;485.170898;562.094666;515.003479])	Hereafter, we take the volume [formula] of the sample equal to one. In heterogeneous materials, [formula] depends on constitutive parameters randomly varying from point to point. For linear conducting media with [formula], where [formula] is the local random conductivity and [formula] is the electric current, we have

text	168	173	(2;[54.000000;418.375488;562.094666;450.893555])	In the analogous effective permittivity problem the dissipated power is replaced by the stored energy [formula] ([formula] is the permittivity). For this reason, we shall abusively refer to [formula] as the "energy density" hereafter. In the nonlinear problem, [formula] is a non-quadratic function of [formula].
text	175	180	(2;[54.000000;374.041718;562.094666;415.331299])	An alternative to solving Maxwell's equations is to minimize the total energy [formula] subjected to the two constraints [\cite=WILL86] [\cite=SANC87]: (i) [formula] and (ii) [formula]; here, the bar stands for a spatial average, and [formula] is a constant applied electric field. The minimum, [formula], is expected to be self-averaging, as occurs for the free-energy in disordered systems. We can therefore write

text	197	201	(2;[54.000000;215.527771;562.094666;245.360397])	The problem thus reduces to computing the average of the constrained minimum of a functional of the electric field. The electric field derives from a potential and has a fixed mean value. We can rewrite the constrained minimum in ([\ref=mini]) using a path integral

The replica method relies on the fact that one can easily compute the replicated partition function [formula] for [formula] integer, and subsequently take the limit [formula]. The main quantity of interest therefore is

Volume integrals may then to be identified with sums over sites (each pertaining to one cell) according to the correspondence [formula], where [formula] is an infinitesimal cell volume (which defines the microscopic correlation length of the problem). Then, [formula] simplifies to

That is, we assume that the local energy density is distributed according to the probability distribution

A method for extracting from the path integral the second-order weak-contrast perturbation expansion of the effective potential [formula], for nonlinear media, has been introduced in Ref.[\cite=BART98].

We first present the principle for building such approximations through the introduction of a trial Hamiltonian. Then, we discuss the choice of a trial Hamiltonian with replica couplings. Finally, we explain how to exploit these replica couplings in order to obtain two kinds of self-consistent formulas.

text	316	319	(4;[54.000000;731.364197;562.094666;761.196777])	The common ingredient to the approximations discussed below is the introduction of a linear comparison medium described by a trial Hamiltonian [formula] which is quadratic in the electric field and non-random, e.g.the one-parameter ansatz
formula	321	323	(4;[240.921844;695.712097;562.094666;720.729553])	[formula]
text	324	328	(4;[54.000000;654.248657;562.094666;684.081238])	where [formula] is to be determined by an appropriate self-consistency condition. This Hamiltonian is that of a (replicated) homogeneous medium, but without couplings between replicas. Its meaning and that of other possible choices with replica couplings are discussed below.
text	330	330	(4;[54.000000;642.791626;279.058105;650.263611])	The partition function [formula] can be rewritten as
formula	332	341	(4;[184.471054;605.046021;562.094666;629.666382])	[formula]
text	342	342	(4;[54.000000;584.005981;170.839890;590.924500])	or, with another notation
formula	344	349	(4;[240.984543;553.003113;562.094666;571.434143])	[formula]
text	350	352	(4;[54.000000;522.453125;562.094666;542.368530])	where [formula] is the partition function associated to [formula], and [formula] stands for the functional average with weights [formula]. Equ.([\ref=wstar]) thus reads

text	371	372	(4;[54.000000;371.763245;267.519836;380.176086])	A natural self-consistency condition for [formula] is

For more general choices of [formula] with several free parameters, ([\ref=sccond]) only provides a relation between these parameters, and additional considerations are in order to determine them all. First of all, we have to precise the form of the ansatz to be used in our calculations.

text	386	394	(4;[54.000000;201.675537;562.094666;245.013062])	We deduce here the form of the trial Hamiltonian [formula] from an analysis of the effective Hamiltonian [formula]. Eq.([\ref=heff]) shows that the effective Hamiltonian is non-random but that the average over disorder introduced a coupling between different replicas. The meaning of these couplings is more transparent if we carry out an expansion of ([\ref=heff]) around the average field [formula] as in the weak-contrast expansion [\cite=BART98]. With [formula] and [formula] we have

We thus see that the coupling between replicas acts only within clusters defined by [formula]-point connected correlation functions [formula], and accounts for the fluctuations of the electric field in these clusters. The replica coupling would vanish if there were no disorder at all. In the limit where the size of the region defined by [formula] shrinks to zero - which means that the system is observed at a macroscopic level, we can approximate

The presence of [formula] in front of the replica coupling term is the macroscopic remnant of a microscopic average having been taken within a two-particle cluster, of center [formula] and volume [formula]. This discussion therefore enlightens a relation between replica coupling and the electric field fluctuations within clusters.

In particular, [formula] was treated as a mere number. We now discuss what happens when self-consistency is imposed, within some approximation scheme. The medium is made of [formula] phases labelled by [formula], of respective conductivities [formula] and volume concentrations [formula].

This expression distinguishes between different contributions to the field fluctuations: (i) the first term represents fluctuations coming from the "macroscopic" background effective medium [formula]; (ii) the second one is that already found in ([\ref=qq]), and would be the only one if [formula] were independent from [formula], and if [formula] were equal to [formula], the trivial value corresponding to a non-fluctuating reference medium for a multiphase composite, cf.Appendix [\ref=qfotf]; (iii) and finally a third term comes from the dependence of [formula] on [formula] and [formula]. Both last terms are, according to the interpretation of replica coupling developped in the previous section, of "microscopic" origin.

According to ([\ref=qberg]), this procedure makes the effective-medium insensitive to the fluctuations generated in the reference medium [formula], so that relevant fluctuations only come from [formula].

text	882	889	(10;[54.000000;252.828979;562.094666;294.672058])	We plot in Fig. [\ref=fig1] (resp.[\ref=fig2]) the "type 2" scaled conductivities [formula] versus [formula], the volume fraction of material 2, for a dielectric ratio [formula] (resp.[formula]). We also show the Hashin-Shtrikman (HS) bounds [\cite=HASH62], the Hori-Yonezawa formula which comes from a cumulant series (CS) approximation, and the one-impurity (OI) Bruggeman formula. The dimension is [formula]. Figs.[\ref=fig3] and [\ref=fig4] display similar plots for [formula].
text	891	910	(10;[54.000000;126.801575;562.094666;248.843933])	For moderate contrast (Figs.1 and 3), we observe that all four self-consistent formulas lie close to each other. This is a consequence of the fact that they are exact to second order in the contrast. Also, for any contrast, the slopes at [formula] and [formula] are all identical, which is a consequence of the fact that they are exact to second order in the dilute limit [formula] (the expression near [formula] is obtained by replacing [formula] by [formula] and by interchanging [formula] and [formula]). We also observe that the HS bounds are satisfied in each case considered. However, the formulas obtained via the cumulant series summation, i.e.both the HY formula and its "type 2" counterpart, do not reduce to the exact result [formula] in dimension 1 (not shown). This exact result is also the common value of the HS bounds for [formula]. Hence, formulas derived from the cumulant series approximation do not obey the HS bounds in dimension [formula]. On the other hand, both the Bruggeman formula and its "type 2" counterpart do reduce to the exact result when [formula], and can be seen to always obey the HS bounds whatever [formula] is. The one-impurity approximation scheme therefore appears to be of better physical relevance for all dimensions, than the cumulant series approximation.
text	912	942	(11;[54.000000;596.540100;562.094666;786.771179])	We now discuss the critical behavior. First of all, the percolation thresholds found in the"type 2" formulas are [formula] (cumulant series) and [formula] (one-impurity). These thresholds are the percolation thresholds of the Potts model, and that of the Bethe lattice model, respectively. Both thresholds decrease as [formula] when [formula], which is the exact asymptotics. The Bethe and Potts models are mean-field models, where emphasis is put on fluctuations in the couplings between a given site and its neighbours. On the contrary, in effective-medium theories, interactions between impurities are taked into account through the self-consistent background medium. Such interactions are more important for low dimensions. Effective-medium theories therefore overestimate interactions in high dimensions, whereas mean-field models are expected to underestimate them in low dimensions. Above the upper critical dimension where mean-field models are accurate, interactions between impurities become irrelevant. According to this discussion, our "type 2" formulas appear as hybrids between mean-field and usual effective-medium theories, and are expected to be mostly relevant in dimensions intermediate between [formula] and the upper critical dimension [formula]. Indeed, the condition [formula] minimizes the influence of the background medium and, according to the interpretation developped in Sec.[\ref=rcacota], replica coupling has to do with couplings between neighboring points. The reason for which the introduction of a replica-coupling ansatz yields the exact thresholds of mean-field theories will have to be clarified in the future. In Fig.[\ref=fig5], we plot the quadratic fluctuations [formula] as a function of [formula]. The fluctuations in the "type 2" estimates are greatly reduced compared to those of the Bruggeman and HY formula. This is consistent with the fact that the influence of the background is reduced.
text	944	950	(11;[54.000000;550.711914;562.094666;592.001526])	"Type 1" formulas give exponents [formula], while for "type 2" formulas they are [formula], [formula]. Mean-field theories yield [formula], [formula] which are the exact values for [formula]. It is interesting to compare these values to exact bounds deduced from the Nodes-Links-Blobs (NLB) model, in all dimensions. The NLB model is currently accepted as a good one for the backbone structure of real random resistor networks[\cite=STAU92]. The bounds read
formula	954	956	(11;[256.931824;515.156006;562.094666;537.073853])	[formula]
text	958	981	(11;[54.000000;356.561493;562.094666;501.978455])	where [formula] is the correlation length exponent: [formula]. They hold for [formula], whereas for [formula] the right-hand sides in ([\ref=expbounds]) are fixed to their [formula] values. These bounds follow, e.g., from comparing the lower and upper exact bounds obtained in Ref.[\cite=WRIG86] for the noise exponent [formula] in weakly nonlinear networks, within the NLB scheme. They are satisfied by simulation results [\cite=WRIG86]. Using the usual effective-medium values [formula] in ([\ref=expbounds]) implies the absurd value [formula], save for [formula] where a finite value of [formula] is allowed. Though information about the correlation length [formula] (and therefore about [formula]) is not included in the Bruggeman nor in the HY formulas, the above bounds show that, as long as they are meant to model percolating systems obeying the NLB picture, these formulas are truly adequate only in dimension [formula] - and [formula] where the Bruggeman formula is exact. As to "type 2" formulas, we insert the values [formula], [formula] into ([\ref=expbounds]) and deduce that [formula], a reasonable expression for [formula] only. If we furthermore insist on having [formula] as in real systems, these heuristic arguments restrict the range of validity of the new formulas to [formula]. Note, moreover, that only in dimension [formula] are the exponents equal: [formula], because of self-duality [\cite=STRA77]. A formula with unequal exponents therefore is expected to be essentially relevant to dimensions [formula].
text	983	996	(11;[54.000000;274.867920;562.094666;352.022919])	We also quote theoretical bounds for [formula] due to Golden, valid for hierarchical NLB models: [formula] for [formula] and [formula] for [formula] [\cite=GOLD90]. The above analysis is consistent with these bounds, and can be summarized as a set of prescriptions for using the "best" available effective medium theories, as far as a non-conflicting critical behaviour is concerned: for [formula], Bruggeman's formula, or its "type 2" counterpart are exact; for [formula], the Bruggeman or HY formulas are adequate; for [formula], "type 2" formulas are applicable; finally, for [formula] mean-field theories would be the most relevant. Estimates or exact values for the exponents are [\cite=STAU92]: [formula], [formula], [formula], [formula], [formula]. These values support our prescriptions.
text	998	999	(11;[54.000000;253.448181;562.094666;271.823700])	An interesting observation is that actually both "type 1" and "type 2" formulas can be given by a variational formulation as
formula	1001	1008	(11;[237.724243;191.747253;562.094666;241.619904])	[formula]

Indeed, at least in the framework of the two different models introduced in Sec.[\ref=tm], the curves for [formula] and [formula] are found to have the form shown in Fig.6. The infimum ([\ref=min]) occurs at [formula], whereas the solution [formula] to the equation [formula] corresponds to a maximum of [formula]. Both types of theories can therefore be interpreted as extremal theories in the framework of self-consistent models built on the replica-coupling ansatz. The physical meaning of this interpretation is still not clear. However, "type 2" formulas should not been disregarded as unphysical because of their showing up as maximal ones: the minimization principle states that the dissipated power is minimized with respect to the electric field; but there is no reason why an extremization with respect to arbitrary variational parameters should not lead to a maximum of the dissipated power. Eqs.([\ref=min]), ([\ref=max]) explain why for a given approximation, one always has [formula] in Figs.1-4.
text	1029	1048	(12;[54.000000;619.454163;562.094666;729.486023])	We now consider some points that were not explicitly treated in the paper. First, we presented the formalism in terms of the electric field [formula], from which we obtained a conductivity [formula]. The electric current [formula] (or the induction [formula]), could be used instead [\cite=BART98]. In such a formulation, the random constitutive parameter is the resistivity [formula] and the constraints are [formula] and [formula]. One then computes an effective resistivity [formula]. Both formulations are equivalent, but a given approximation scheme in general leads to different results for [formula] and [formula]. Preliminary investigations of "type 2" formulas have been led in this case. These will be presented elsewhere. Finally, we discuss the natural question about the possibility of replica-symmetry breaking [\cite=PARI84]. Replica symmetry breaking introduces more free parameters in the ansatz, and the final extremization has to be carried out with respect to several variables. There is no frustration in this problem, and we therefore expect the replica symmetric solution to be the only one. In order to test this, we tried a one-step symmetry-breaking solution and did indeed not find any new solution.

text	1053	1067	(12;[54.000000;468.531464;562.094666;567.106262])	We presented a functional approach to the calculation of effective-medium properties of random media. We showed how to recover the Bruggeman and Hori-Yonezawa formulas by using specific approximation schemes to the basic functional integral. We also discussed the introduction of a replica-coupling parameter in a gaussian Ansatz, from which new effective-medium formulas were obtained. These formulas appear to be more adequate in [formula] compared to the standard ones by Bruggeman and HY. Because it yields a sensible result in all dimensions, and fulfills all the constraints required to deserve the label of a "good" effective-medium theory, the "type 2" counterpart of the Bruggeman formula offers an interesting alternative to the latter. Indeed, it has a percolation threshold equal to [formula] in three dimensions. This is closer to values observed in real materials, compared to the [formula] of the Bruggeman formula which often constitutes an overestimation.

We note that if [formula] (an exact upper bound for the effective conductivity), then [formula]. Therefore, [formula] defines a trivial model of a medium which is a composite, but from which field fluctations are nonetheless absent.
