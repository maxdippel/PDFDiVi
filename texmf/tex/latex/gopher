   We have developed an interactive electronic preprint service which
cooperates with the gr-qc, hep-lat, hep-ph, hep-th, and nucl-th boards.
This service, which is based upon the Gopher protocol, allows you to
retrieve listings, abstracts, and papers interactively. Gopher allows you
to retrieve documents directly through a menu-based system (without invoking 
the mail system or anonymous ftp).  Authors and Titles of papers appear 
on your screen, and you simply choose an entry (title or abstract) in order 
to retrieve it.  In addition to direct retrieval of papers and abstracts,
interactive searches of all the abstracts are available.  These searches 
can be subject-specific or run across all of the boards listed above.

   In order to access these services, you must install a gopher client
on your local machine.  Clients with X-window, ASCII terminal (VMS or
UNIX-curses) , NeXT, Mac, and PC interfaces exist, and are available 
through anonymous ftp at boombox.micro.umn.edu.  We have also constructed 
a revised X-window client which contains extra hooks allowing the user to 
automatically run TeX or LaTeX on a document.  The resulting manuscript 
can either be viewed on the screen or printed.  This client can be obtained 
through anonymous ftp to qmc.lanl.gov.  

   Instructions for installing these clients are included in the various
software packages. These clients should be set up to contact the Gopher 
server at mentor.lanl.gov on port 70.  The title of the host server is 
'LANL Physics Information Service'. 

   A related Gopher service which includes a wide variety of physics
subject matter is available at granta.uchicago.edu on port 70. The
title of this service is 'Physics Resources (Experimental)'.

   If you have questions concerning this service, please contact:
gopher-admin@mentor.lanl.gov or gopher-admin@qmc.lanl.gov.
