REVISION HISTORY FOR AASTEX PACKAGE

v4.0, May 95
        This was a major package revision, adding markup needed to make
        the manuscripts more "electronic", as well as fixing many of the bugs
        reported by users, particularly in the plano table markup.

        Many style and doc files have undergone a name change; in most cases
        a ``4'' was simply appended to the old file name to represent the
        package version number.

        Several new markup commands were implemented, and a couple of existing
        ones were modified:

           \planotable -> \deluxetable     aasms,aaspp,aaspptwo,aj_pt,apjpt
           Name of environment for planotable changed to deluxetable in all 
           style files.  Synonym for \planotable added for backwards 
           compatibility.  Beginning and end of data portion of a deluxetable 
           must now be delimited by \startdata ... \enddata

           \thebibliography                aasms,aaspp,aaspptwo,aj_pt,apjpt
           Mandatory argument added to make the definition comply with the
           LaTeX manual.  However, the argument is simply consumed and is not 
           used by the definition.  It is not necessary (or advisable) to use 
           \reference at the beginning of a reference in a \bibitem.

           \authoremail                    aasms,aaspp,aaspptwo,aj_pt,apjpt 
           \authoremail{EMAIL} added to all styles.  The E-mail address is
           consumed and not typeset.  NOTE: while this markup was added, we do 
           not anticipate its usage at this time.

           \place(table,figure,plate)      aasms,aaspp,aaspptwo,aj_pt,apjpt
           \placetable{KEY}, \placefigure{KEY}, and \placeplate{KEY} are
           used by authors to indicate exactly where they intend tables, 
           figures, and/or plates to be placed in the typeset article.  It
           requires the author to attach a \label{KEY} after (or within) a 
           \caption{} command in the item to be placed.  In aasms, aj_pt, 
           and apjpt, these commands emit some vertical space surrounding 
           centered text that says

                EDITOR:  PLACE TABLE n HERE

           (or PLACE FIGURE or PLACE PLATE, whichever is appropriate).  In 
           the aaspp and aaspptwo styles, the commands emit no text whatever.
 
           \notetoeditor                   aasms,aaspp,aaspptwo,aj_pt,apjpt
           \notetoeditor{TEXT} communicates information to the copy editor
           from the author.  In the manuscript styles (aasms, aj_pt, and 
           apjpt), it behaves like a footnote, generating a superior "E1", 
           "E2", etc., with an associated footnote that writes "E1 NOTE TO 
           EDITOR: <TEXT>".  In the preprint styles (aaspp and aaspptwo), 
           \notetoeditor{TEXT} produces no output at all.

           \epsscale                       aasms,aaspp,aaspptwo,aj_pt,apjpt
           Added \epsscale{NUM} to permit authors to override default
           scaling for \plotone EPS files.  Code changes were minor and taken 
           from KPNO proposal style file found on ftp.kpno.edu (as per 
           instructions from cbiemes).

           \ptlandscape                    aasms
           Made sure \ptlandscape existed in the plano styles (it did).
           Added a null definition for \ptlandscape to aasms.  In the initial
           discussions of the ToDo list, cbiemes decided that getting 
           \ptlandscape to invoke "something like rotate.sty" on a per-tale 
           basis was not crucial for this release and would require nontrivial
           programming.

           \arcdeg                         aasms,aaspp,aaspptwo,aj_pt,apjpt
           Symbol \deg changed to \arcdeg in all styles.  Required to
           avoid naming conflict with the obscure \deg "log-like" function in 
           math mode.

           \tablecolumns                   aasms,aaspp,aaspptwo,aj_pt,apjpt
           \tablecolumns{N} command added to all styles.  This command
           sets the number of columns recognized by the \cutinhead and 
           \sidehead commands regardless of the actual number of column 
           headings defined in the \tablehead command.  The specific purpose 
           is for authors that use \multicolumn or other LaTeX column stuff 
           to define a "fancy" heading.  Implementation required a new internal
           counter, \pt@column.  NOTE: This command will not work *within* 
           the \tablehead command, but works fine if given before or after.

           \label in deluxetables          aasms,aaspp,aaspptwo,aj_pt,apjpt
           This did not actually involve a code change, just investigation 
           into how \tablecaption interacts with \label.  Currently,
           \tablecaption is *not* equivalent to \caption.  Following 
           \tablecaption with a \label does not result in the expected output.  
           An interim solution is to say that \label can *only* appear *within*
           a \tablecaption, analogously to putting it in the \caption argument 
           of a figure or table.  Similarly, \tablenum and \figurenum now 
           properly set \@currentlabel.

           amssym.sty
           amssym.sty file added to distribution.

           \phantom shorthand              aasms,aaspp,aaspptwo,aj_pt,apjpt
           The four following commands have been added as shorthand for common 
           uses of the \phantom command that are useful for aligning data in 
           table columns:

             \def\phn{\phantom{0}}     % Phantom numeral for aligning columns 
                                         in tables
             \def\phd{\phantom{.}}     % Phantom decimal for aligning columns 
                                         in tables
             \def\phs{\phantom{$-$}    % Phantom minus sign for aligning 
                                         columns in tables
             \def\phm#1{\phantom{#1}}  % Generic \phantom command

           \figcaption[figname]{TEXT}
           Added: takes text, possibly including a \label command, and just 
           prints it in paragraph mode.  It does not float, but merely prints 
           out the caption in paragraph form and increments the figure counter.
           The optional filename, which is not printed, allows for easier 
           cross-referencing to an external figure file.

           \dummytable
           Added: It increments the table counter, but does not
           print anything. Also sets \@currentlabel so that subsequent \label
           commands will work correctly.  This is useful for referring in text
           to planotables which appear elsewhere.

           \markcite{KEY}
           \reference{KEY}
           These pieces of markup now require an argument.

        Additional changes were made that did not effect the mark-up of 
        manuscripts:

           \pt@nl                      aasms,aaspp,aaspptwo,aj_pt,apjpt 
           Moved the line containing '\global\pt@line=0%' to follow the line
           '\global\pt@ncol=0%'.  This fixed the bug that effected pagebreaks 
           and having the first field in the first column of the second page 
           blanked out.  Added a \typeout{} command to report the width of the 
           table for each page, rather than just the last page.

           \revtex@ver \revtex@date        aasms,aaspp,aaspptwo,aj_pt,apjpt
           Version changed to 4.0Beta, revision date changed to 01-Sep-94 
           for all style files.

           \thesection, et al.             aasms,aaspp,aaspptwo,aj_pt,apjpt
           Eliminated trailing "." from \thesection et al. and added it
           to the sectioning command \@startsection.  The same thing was done 
           for the appendix sectioning commands.
  
           \appendix                       aasms,aaspp,aaspptwo,aj_pt,apjpt
           The need for this fix was added by C. Beimesderfer during a
           conversation on May 15, 1994.  The definition of \appendix was 
           modified to redefine \section so that the equation number counter 
           is reset to zero for each section.  So the equation numbers will 
           look like A1, A2, ..., B1, B2, etc.  Tables and figures are still
           numbered consecutively from the beginning of the document, 
           reflecting the old (paper) usage of putting tables and figures at 
           the end of the document.

           \@tightleading                  aasms
           Disabled \@tightleading in aasms.  This was done by making the
           tight leading amount equal the double leading amount.  The result 
           is that \tighten in the preamble has no effect.  All manusscripts 
           are automatically double-spaced.  An author must use the preprint 
           styles to get single-spaced text.

           \colhead                        aasms,aaspp,aaspptwo,aj_pt,apjpt
           Redefined \colhead to simply be \multicolumn{1}{c}{<heading>}.
           Left in the code that advances the counter \pt@ncol by one.

           \altaffiltext                   aaspptwo
           Fixed footnote counter increment, i.e. added \stepcounter{footnote} 
           to the definition.

           \setcounter{topnumber}{7}       aasms,aaspp,aaspptwo,aj_pt,apjpt
           Increase the number of figure captions allowed on one page
           explicitly to 7.  My tests revealed no prior problem, however there 
           are some installations out there that are more restrictive.

           \footnotesize                   aasms
           Make \small and \footnotesize do what is expected in the
           manuscript style.  \small already worked normally, albeit almost
           imperceptibly (it only adjusts the point size down by one, from
           12->11pt).  Only aasms.sty sets \footnotesize=\normalsize.  Commands
           added to deluxetable environment to temporarily reset \footnotesize 
           to its normal setting and then set it back to \normalsize on exit.

           \tablenotetext                  aasms
           Correct spacing problem in tablenotes that span more than a
           single line of text.  The symptom here was that tablenotes were 
           properly double-spaced unless the text spans more than one line.  
           In this case the text of the last line of the note is only 
           single-space height above the next note, something like this:
        
              1 This is note one.  The text spans to

              the next line.
              2 This is the second note. 

           The change required setting \parskip=1.5ex in the block that 
           actually prints the note text tokens out.  Somewhere deep in the 
           LaTeX system code for the environment that contains the notes, 
           \parskip (the space between paragraphs) was reset to 0.

           \tablevspace                    aasms,aasppt,aaspptwo,aj_pt,apjpt
           \tablevspace was not working correctly.  There was an extra
           set of braces in the definition.

           \cutinhead                      aj_pt,apjpt
           \cutinhead was not working correctly in the *pt styles.  The
           adjustment for the horizontal rules was copied directly from the 
           aasms style, which is double-spaced.  The placement was corrected.

           \deluxetable                    aasms,aaspp,aaspptwo,aj_pt,apjpt
           For multi-page tables, print the tablewidth for every page, not
           just the last.  A new counter, \pt@page, was added to keep track 
           of the current page number of the table so that messsages like so 
           appear:

              Page 2 of table 3 has been set to width 426.897pt

           \epsscale & \plotone            aasms,aaspp,aaspptwo,aj_pt,apjpt
           The internal command for adjusting the scaling of the Postscript 
           plot in the \plotone command was corrected.  The corrected
           portion of \plotone now reads as:
                
               \epsfxsize=\eps@scaling\columnwidth

           \ptlandscape                    aj_pt,apjpt
           \voffset=-.25in added to \ptlandscape to shift the output up
           by a quarter inch.  This should make the output approximately 
           centered on the page, however printers tend to vary in their margin 
           settings, so different output may be produced on different printers.

           \section                        aasms,aaspp,aj_pt,apjpt
           Sectioning was broken in that a section header could be printed on 
           the bottom of a page by itself when the page should have been 
           cleared and the section header printed on the next page.  This was 
           corrected by eliminating the \center-\endcenter environment that 
           surrounded the section heading format macro and replacing it with 
           a simple \centering command.

           \received \accepted             aasms,aaspp,aaspptwo,aj_pt,apjpt
           If the \received and \accepted commands are given null arguments, 
           error messages were generated when the slug line data were formatted 
           by the \begin{abstract} command.  This was corrected by making the 
           internal command that formats \received and \accepted check for 
           null arguments.

           \farcs \farcm                   aasms,aaspp,aaspptwo,aj_pt,apjpt
           Adjusted the kerning of the arcsecond symbol over the decimal point 
           so that the symbols are typeset more attractively.  In the apjpt 
           style, the adjustments are more complicated owing to the reduced 
           point size.

           \tablecaption                   aasms,aaspp,aaspptwo,aj_pt,apjpt
           If a table caption is wider than a table, it was formatted to 
           \textwidth, rather than the width of the table.  This was fixed so 
           that, as long as the author specifies a nonzero table width, the 
           caption is centered in a \parbox of that width.

           \normalsize                     art8.sty
           Command \@normalsize changed to \normalsize.
 
           \nodata 
           This command is no longer centered in a column, but behaves as the 
           column it is embedded in. This is done my making it equal ~...~ so 
           as to reserve some space at either end.

	   \mathletters
	   The internal definition of this environment changed in order to
	   avoid stack overflow problems under LaTeX2e.

v3.1, Feb 93

	Added \applopt synonym for \ao.  (J.Sexton, ApJ, 2/18)

	Added \ptlandscape to apjpt style.  (B.Januzzi, IAS, 2/19)

v3.0, Dec 1992
	Moved page numbers to top of pages, per request from ApJ
	editorial office.  Created "plaintop" pagestyle for MSs that
	numbers pages at the top of the sheet, centered.

	Added \tablerefs, \tablecomments, \cutinhead, and \sidehead,
	macros to facilitate handling complexities in ApJ/AJ tables.

	Added plano tables styles (non-trivial!).  This includes some
	new author markup that is applicable to "long" tables in MSs
	as well.  Added a "planotables" environment, and commands
	for identifying structural parts of the table: \tablewidth,
	\tablecaption, \tablehead, \colhead, \tableheadfrac, \tabletail,
	\startdata, \nodata, \nl, \tablevspace, \tablebreak, and, in
	the plano style files, \ptlandscape.

	Fixed bug with preliminary plano tables that prevented \nodata
	symbol to be justified with numerals (usually r).  The ellipsis
	or em-dash (or whatever) now centers horizontally as well as
	vertically.  (C.Pilachowski, G.Brady)

	Added some internal parameterization and control of automatic
	upper-casing of section heads, etc.  Authors should NOT be
	instructed to upper case anything; the style should do this
	when necessary.  See remarks in .doc file for more information
	about how the style designer can control this "easily".

	Footnotes in MSs are same size as body text.

	Fixed bug in \altaffiltext so that increment LaTeX footnote now
	increments with alternate affiliation footnotes.  The first
	footnote called out in the text will then be properly numbered
	N+1, where N is the number of \altaffiltexts.

	Added markup for ionization state: \ion.

	Added \singlespace, \doublespace so that leading can be
	adjusted by authors.  Use of these is not encouraged.

	Changed \keywords syntax.  Authors are now required to provide
	proper punctuation in the keyword list.  The earlier attempt at
	parsing the keywords was problematic.

	Added EPS inclusion macros.  These are designed to work with
	Rokicki's dvips program.  There is some concern that these
	should have been designed to work with psfig instead.  My
	opinion about that is that intermediate layer (psfig) is
	redundant with this package and by relying on it we require
	authors to have two additional add-on packages (dvips and
	psfig) rather than one.  The psfig package and the EPS part
	of the AASTeX package both serve the same purpose, namely,
	to isolate the author from the details of the DVI driver.
	The AASTeX package goes a bit farther in explicilty defining
	descriptive markup semantics for specifying external plot files.

	Revisions for compliance with RevTeX markup.
	Changed \tightenlines -> \tighten.  Changed \alt -> \lesssim,
	\agt -> \gtrsim.  Changed \text -> \case.  Added \slantfrac.
	Changed \applopt -> \ao.

	Added slug line markup for assorted administrative details.
	\revised, \paperid, \ccc, \cpright, \rectohead, \versohead, and
	\slugcomment can all be used in preamble.  Formatting for slug
	line data has been isolated in internal \@dates, \@runheads,
	\@slug, and \@makeslugcmmnt.  \@journalname and \cpr@holder
	have been added as internal parameters.

	Added \authoraddr front matter (or back matter, whatever)
	command for specifying author's postal address.  This is the
	address that is preferred for correspondence.

	Added \markcite to correspond with references environment
	to provide non-BibTeX-based citation and reference list
	markup.  \markcite does not do anything typographically in
	AAS styles because the citation call-out style is straight
	text.  This is included partly for symmetry, but mostly
	because we want to start training authors to identify
	structure in their manuscripts.  In the future, browsers
	with hypertext-like capabilities will be widely available
	to build linkage between citations, references, and the
	articles being cited/referenced, and this will facilitate
	preparation of the articles for such systems.

	Changed \appendix to reset the equation counter and to
	redefine \theequation.

	Added mathletters environment to support "subequations".
	This environment is used to suspend incrementing of the
	primary equation counter in favor of a secondary one, so
	that related equations can be grouped with the same
	identifying number while still being separately identified
	with lower case letters.  I originally called this new
	environment "letteredsubeqn" but changed to "mathletters"
	for RevTeX compliance.

	Added \eqnum, \tablenum, and \figurenum commands to enable
	authors to override LaTeX automatic numbering for equations,
	tables and figures.  The corresponding LaTeX counter is NOT
	auto-incremented when these commands are used.  The commands
	function by temporarily overriding \the<counter>; formatting
	defined by \@eqnnum, \fnum@table, and \fnum@figure  is not
	affected.  Note that these commands must be used *inside* the
	appropriate displayed equation or float environment.

v2.3, Aug 1992
	Formalized naming convention for style files (see Stynames.spc).

	Revisions for compliance with RevTeX markup.
	Added some revtex@ parameters for software development and
	tracking/reporting purposes.  Changed mathsec substyle option
	to eqsecnum (mathsec.sty -> eqsecnum.sty).  Changed
	\mathwithsecnums -> \eqsecnum.  Changed \la -> \alt,
	\ga -> \agt.  Added \text for cased fractions.

	Revised aasms to conform with preferences of UofC Press manuscript
	editors.  Such things as ragged right text, no hyphenation, proper
	double spacing in tables, etc. are ensured.  (G.Brady)

	Fixed bug that resulted in the persistent \footnoterule in table
	footnotes.  (C.Pilachowski, P.Shopbell)

	Added a Makefile to ease development.

v2.2, Aug 1991
	Rewrote the tablenote code, using ideas from a style file posted
	to the Usenet in June.  This new implementation permits the use
	of any identifying letters (or number for that matter) for the
	notes, and will print them in the order specified by the user
	rather than assuming alphabetical.  In the process, fixed a bug
	where the buffered tablenotes were not being erased from table
	to table.

	Revised the way journal abbreviations are typeset.  Rather than
	simply being a string, they are now processed through a macro and
	the journal type style is parameterized.

	Moved the WGAS ID footnote to the last page of references from
	title page.  There have been some "complaints" about this being
	present at all, but it is the only way we can keep track of the
	use of the package at this point, so we retain it.

v2.1, May 1991
	Changed style filenames: aasmanuscript -> aasms, aaspreprint -> aaspp
