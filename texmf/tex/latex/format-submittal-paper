Format for Papers in the Chemical Physics Preprint Database 

TeX and LaTeX are the preferred publication formatters for the preprint
database. TeX is a paper formatter which is available on all computer 
platforms free of charge.  Use of other formats will:

    limit the number of clients who can read
        your paper.
    inundate you with complaints from potential readers
        who cannot read your paper 

Papers which are submitted or replaced must be submitted with an 
identification line(s), an abstract for the database, and the body of the 
paper as submitted to the journal. Each of these sections begins with 
a line containing ``\\'' as the first two characters.

	\\
	identification line
	\\
	abstract for the database
	\\
	paper


The identification line consists of title, authors, journal to which the
paper has been submitted, # of pages, and your personal report #.  Only the
title and author are necessary.  If the journal name is added, users can
look for the paper's publication.  Indicating the number of pages
involved, helps verify that a retrieval of the paper is successful.

The identification line and the abstract for the database  must be
shorter than 24 lines.  Lines beyond this limit will be truncated.

The body of the paper includes the title/author(s), abstract, text, and
figures of the paper as sent to the publisher.  

The commands to submit a paper include ``put'' used for a first time
submittal and ``replace'' used to make ANY changes in the paper.

Fourier Path Integral Monte Carlo Method for the Calculation of the
Microcanonical Density of States, David L. Freeman, Department of
Chemistry, The University of Rhode Island, Kingston, RI 02881 and J.D.
Doll, Department of Chemistry, Brown University, Providence, RI 02912,
Journal of Chemical Physics, 8 pages.
\\
Using a Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation coupled with Fourier path
integral methods, expressions are derived for the numerical evaluation
of the microcanonical density of states for quantum particles obeying
Boltzmann statistics. A numerical algorithmis suggested to evaluate the
quantum density of states and illustrated on a one-dimensional model 
system.

introductory line with the title and authors' names and the first
abstract) will be stripped off for use in the notification sent to 
users of papers recently added to the archive and in the listings.
 

Format for Multipart Papers 
---------------------------

Concatenating multipart papers together for submission is the preferred 
method.  In this discussion figures are not treated as one of the 
multiparts; figures  are submitted using the ``figures'' command.  

If one must submit a multipart paper, tar the files together,
uuencode them, and compress the files.  Use ``get uufiles'' to obtain a
utility that does this in one step.  

The  csh script uufiles also allows -gz and -gz -9 options which are usually 
more efficient than compression, but the gnu utilities would have to be 
installed on your system as well as the receiver's system.  

For information on compression for macs and vax vms systems, use ``get 
macinfo'' or ``get vmstools'' from chem-ph@arXiv.org. 


Macros, Scripts, and Utilities 
------------------------------

Common macros, scripts, and utilities used to send, receive, or translate 
papers to and from the database to postscript are maintained as part of 
the database.

List the macros, scripts and utilities:
	
	 Through email, use

		To: chem-ph@arXiv.org
		Subject: list macros

	 Using the www server via mosaic, lynx, etc.:
		From the homepage of the preprint service (URL 
		http://www.chem.brown.edu/chem-ph.html), look
		under ``Additional:'' and click on ``macros'' 
		or ``description''.

                Subject: get macroname 

where ``macroname'' is the name of the macro, script, or utility you wish
to retrieve.

 	
Submit macros, scripts, and utilities to the database. 
Please send us commonly used macros.  Any `standard' macro package may be 
submitted using the ``comment'' command.

                Subject: comment

		useful to the database because.... 

Personal macros which are not of general interest should be included as
part of the paper which you submit.


Reformatting Text with Lines Longer than 80 Characters 
------------------------------------------------------

Authors submitting papers should be careful that no lines are longer than
80 characters.  Many mailers will automatically linewrap with carriage
returns which could cause problems. For example, a carriage return
inserted in the middle of a macro name would not work.

 A c program that can be used to reformat papers before mailing is 
available as reform.c within the database.  This utility will
insert carriage returns only at suitably chosen spaces.  Use ``get
reform.c'' to retrieve the utility for your use.


Curiosities of Unix Mailers 
---------------------------

Authors should be careful to avoid certain curiosities of Unix
mailers.

For example, any line beginning with the word ``From'' will automatically 
be converted to ``>From''.  This results in an upside down question
mark in the TeXed paper. This can be avoided either by adding a space or
using {}From. 

Similarly a ~ at the beginning of a line is interpreted as an escape 
sequence by Unix mailers and will confuse them. The solution is to insert 
\space or use {}~. Multiple ~'s instead of \quad's or \qquad's are 
sometimes used for spacing.

A line that begins with a period and is otherwise blank is interpreted as 
an EndOfFile by Unix mailers and should be avoided.

 
Problems with Text Submitted from IBM DOS 
-----------------------------------------

It would be helpful if authors burdened with IBM's that still use
non-atandard conventions for symbols such {,},|,~,^ = left/right curly 
brackets, vertical bar, tilde, caret could make the necessary translation 
before submitting.


Problems with Large Files 
-------------------------

While storage is not an issue, most unsuspecting requestors do not wish 
to be bombarded with 2Mb of generated postscript in 20 separate files, 
or 1Mb of tables of numbers. Moreover there are many VAX VMS
and IBM VM systems that will reject most of this mail due to
unsuspecting requestor's insufficent disk allocation. Eventually,
user interfaces will be standardized and allow greater flexibility. 

Submissions should be limited to under 300kb (600 blocks) with a note 
explaining how to obtain any additional figure files, etc. via mail, 
anonymous ftp, or other means.  99% of submissions are within this range.
Postscript figure files should be tar-compressed and uuencoded.
A unix csh script for producing such a file that unpacks itself is 
available via `get uufiles'. 

If you are not using a unix workstation you should get one 
for yourself or your group and get connected to internet.
The workstation will be many times more powerful than whatever 
you are currently using and is available at a fraction of the cost.
