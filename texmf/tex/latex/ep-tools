The Atavachron is an interface to the Astro/Math/Physics preprint
archives from within the GNU Emacs editor. It gives the user a simple
set of commands to get, store, process, and list papers with minimal effort.

the files atavachron.tar.Z and atavachron.ps.Z are available via anonymous ftp
from arXiv.org in the /software directory, and 
from babbage.sissa.it in the /macros directory.

atavachron.tar.Z (120kb) contains
rw-r-----1038/1000   2423 Jan 29 05:32 1993 README
rw-r-----1038/1000  54351 Jan 29 05:28 1993 atavachron.el

and atavachron.ps.Z (80kb) is a (compressed postscript) manual file.

When reading an abstract listing in emacs, either in one of the mail
readers or as a previously saved file (output by Unix Mail perhaps),
placing the point (cursor) anywhere in the abstract of choice, and
typing: `M-x get-paper' automatically opens an ftp socket into the
right archive, transfers the paper, uncompresses it if necessary, and
loads it into a `tex-mode' buffer for [La]TeXing, previewing, and
printing by the usual `tex-mode' facilities.

First though, the Atavachron performs a number of tests to determine the
format in which the paper is stored at the archive. These steps are also
performed by `process-paper' if it is called on a stored paper (See
*Note Processing Functions::, *Note Storing Papers::.) Once its format
is determined, appropriate action is taken based on the configuration
variables (*Note Configuration::). 

This includes extracting appended "PostScript" figures, unpacking
uuencoded figures or data files, untarring compressed packages, and
executing shell scripts.

Paper Formats Supported:
  Single TeX File
  TeX File with Appended "PostScript" Figures
  Shell Script
  Tar Files
  Multiple Archive Files for a Paper:
      * UUENCODED Auxillary Files (Figures, Data, etc.)
      * NON-UUENCODED Files (concatenation papers)
