%  HEP93.STY
%
%  Description:
%       LaTeX style file to produce output that conforms to the standards
%       required for the Proceedings of the Joint International Lepton-
%       Photon symposium & Europhysics Conference on High Energy
%       Physics, 25 July - 1 August 1991
%
%  Columns
%       The title, author and abstract will be printed full width
%       of the page on 1 column; the body of the text is on 2 columns.
%
%  Environment:
%       Should be invoked as an option to the article style, as:
%       \documentstyle[HEP93]{article}
%
%  Location:
%       This file (HEP93.STY) should be placed either in the directory
%       containing your input .TEX file or in the directory TEX$INPUTS.
%
%  Known Bugs:
%       Produces an additional (mostly blank) page of output when \thanks
%       is used.
%
%  User actions required:
%       This file is set up for articles with one (or few) authors.
%       To enable a long list of authors to be printed, the size of
%       the relevant vbox (now set at 1in) needs to be increased
%       (see line 58).
%
%  Support:
%       This style file is completely unsupported, may be used,
%       copied or modified by anybody.
