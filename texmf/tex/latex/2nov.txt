for european users, the database is duplicated as e-mail@babbage.sissa.it

Starting 1 Nov '94, submitters should be certain to use a "structured"
title/author field, e.g.

\\
Title: Recent Seminal Results
Authors: Author One and Author Two
Comments: 3 pages, latex, no figures
Report-no: EFI-94-11
\\
abstract
\\
body of paper

long little-known feature: 
   the www interface automatically translates appearances of url's of the
   form http://hostname/path or ftp://hostname/path that appear as plain
   text in titles or abstracts into hot links.  for example: 
      "for associated mpeg file, see http://myhost.domain/file.mpg"
   when accessed via www pages at xxx.lanl.gov (or babbage.sissa.it) views as
      "for associated mpeg file, see <this URL>"
   (for some examples, search cond-mat via www for the string  http )

for the purposes of automatically compiling references and citation lists
   (e.g. a significant aid to the slac spires-hep database), it is useful
   to include the citation to the arch-ive/papernum in your reference list
   when known (e.g. a string such as cond-mat/9409001 is easily harvested).
   this will also facilitate automatic network hyperlinks of references
   from within papers (see e.g. http://xxx.lanl.gov/hypertex/ ).

------------------------------------------------------------------------
note that there is a new version (10/94) of uufiles  (used for tarring,
compressing, and uuencoding files for e-mail transmission on unix systems).

why tar?
  because it is a convenient way for people who receive a file with many
  parts to unpack it automatically into its component parts properly named
  (without messy cutting and pasting).
why compress?
  because filesizes are typically reduced by at least a factor of two
why uuencode?
  because compressed files are binary and will be corrupted when sent via
  e-mail. (uuencode translates to ascii specifically for e-mail transmission.
  note that raw postscript as well can be corrupted by e-mail transmission
  due to occasional long lines or entry into bitmap mode --- uuencoding
 [after compression, since .ps tends to compress well] eliminates any problems)

what's new:
 the new version of uufiles solves two long-standing nuisances:
 older versions of uuencode that use ' ' instead of '`' (i.e. space instead
 of backquote, as still found on most
 suns) now have this automatically corrected, and versions of uuencode 
 (e.g. on sysV hp) that assign mode 0 to stdin have this corrected to 644.
     uufiles no longer tars single files, instead just compresses.
     uufiles has two new options:
       uufiles -gz
  uses gzip compression, and
       uufiles -gz -9
  uses the slowest compression method (i.e. the optimal compression).
  evidently to use this, you must have the gnu gzip/gunzip utilities installed
  on your system (.gz compression frequently does better than a factor of two
  better than .Z compression on postscript files -- for example, the 
  56 .ps files associated with hep-th/9409195 [a total of 1.7Mb] compressed as
  figs.tar.Z = 542kb ,  whereas figs.tar.gz = 196kb . [of course the recipient
  must have the gunzip utility installed to unpack, but this should by now be
  commonplace since these utilities have been freely distributed for years.])

the new version of uufiles is 100% downwardly compatible in usage, so there is
no reason not to download and install even if you don't yet have gzip/gunzip.
use   get uufiles   via e-mail interface (also available in papers/macros
via anon ftp, or via www under macros).

more frequently asked questions:

why am i instructed to submit first the .tex file as a `put', then submit
the uufiled figures afterwards via the `fig command', rather than simply
submit the .tex (or .dvi) together with any .ps figs (or other attachments)
all uufiled together in the first place?
  this is recommended as a compromise for the electronically disadvantaged.
  those who for whatever reason cannot unpack the uuencoded compressed tar
  files (despite the existence of these utilities on most platforms
  [vax/vms, mac, pc included]) at least get to see the tex file.
  of course any author is free to do as he/she pleases
  (happily complaints go directly to submitter, not to here),
  but better solutions can be implemented as soon as modernized network clients
  are uniformly in use (allowing these systems to discard artifacts of their
  e-mail based origins).
but why can't i already just POST a mime-formatted multipart transmission
to the server via a form page from my www client?
  sadly, because most current www clients are either too primitive 
  or are broken. the next version of mosaic may at least properly support a
  mailto: form which will facilitate pre-formatting submissions. 
  other clients are on the way, but it will be (at least) many months
  before the situation stabilizes and suitable standards are in place.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

anonymous ftp for putting and replacing submissions is available on
xxx.lanl.gov via the commands: fput/freplace  .
first submit via anonymous ftp to xxx.lanl.gov:/incoming , e.g. 
    ftp xxx.lanl.gov
    cd incoming
    put mypaper.tex
 then send an e-mail message with title/author and abstract delimited by \\'s 
 in usual format
To: arch-ive@xxx.lanl.gov
Subject: fput mypaper.tex
 (where arch-ive = hep-th, cond-mat, astro-ph, funct-an, etc. )
 and paper will be transferred as usual. also allows multiple files, e.g. after
 depositing mypaper.tex and myfigs.uu to xxx.lanl.gov:/incoming , use:
Subject: fput mypaper.tex myfigs.uu
 or to replace a pre-existing 9407001, after depositing via anon ftp use
Subject: frep 9407001 mypaper.tex myfigs.uu
 (filenames above are descriptive -- anything goes).

 for further descriptive info, e-mail a message to arch-ive@xxx.lanl.gov with
Subject: get fput.txt

who needs it?  for those who experience no problems with e-mail submissions,
makes little difference. but some sites still have routers that truncate or 
otherwise corrupt outgoing e-mail (e.g. ibm routers in the u.k. with 
misconfigured ascii/ebcdic conversion), or have other problems.
users at such sites can deposit via anonymous ftp with no such problems.

 note that if your site has difficulty receiving files larger than 100kb
 via e-mail, you should use the cget command to send in smaller pieces
 [send a message   Subject: get cget.help   for more details], or use anon
  ftp or www to  retrieve)

For physics Job/Conference announcements, point your www client at
    http://xxx.lanl.gov/Announce/
This system has long been inundated by requests to disseminate physics job 
and conference announcements, but has consciously restricted to 
research dissemination alone.
But with the widespread usage of WorldWideWeb clients, automated short-term
archival systems are now significantly easier to establish and maintain.
Posting to the above is via www and can either be full plain text or can 
include hyperlinks to further information maintained at remote servers.
(Entries can be removed at any time by original submitter.)
There are no plans at present to establish a parallel e-mail interface
(we could do it, but it would be wrong) since form compliant www clients
exist for all platforms (for more info see the www faq,
 http://sunsite.unc.edu/boutell/faq/www_faq.html , 
also available via e-mail e.g. To: hep-th@xxx.lanl.gov  Subject: get wwwfaq  ).
Note also that the above may serve as well as the prototype for an eventual
public commentary system associated to the e-print archives (with full author
control over attachments to any given submission).
