Instructions for e-mail Submissions

Your paper can be submitted by e-mail by sending a message using
the Put command.
First, read the general instructions in our submit help,
and prepare your title and abstract as described in title/abstract preparation.
Then, follow the instructions below to make sure the paper arrives here
successfully. The email address for each archive is given in our
general information.


General Precautions for Sending Files via E-mail


It's easy to submit multiple files: Use uufiles

In order to make using email submissions easy, we have provided programs
on the four major platforms that help automate the process of packaging
files for submission. (We loosely refer to this collection of programs as
`uufiles', although it is named differently on some platforms).
Uufiles allows you to prepare a single .uu file which includes all the files
of your submission. Thus you can include your entire submission (figures, text,
style files, .bbl files,...) in one email message. Uufiles is also convenient
as a way of putting all your files together for ftp or web submissions. 
We give the general instructions for using uufiles below; more detailed
information is found in our uufaq


You may need some utilities

You may need various utilities to package
your submission (notably tar, gzip [or the less efficient Unix LZW compress],
and uuencode). Most unix machines have all of these already installed, but on
other machines you may need to download them. Many submitters can benefit
from perusing the uufaq.


If you have only a single TeX file (no figures, no extra style files)

It is still preferable to submit a single tex file using uufiles, but if
you have some strange aversion, you can still submit the raw tex using
the put command by appending it after your
Title/Author/Abstract information. Since TeX breaks when arbitrary line
breaks are added in (for example, if inserted in the middle of a macro name),
you must wrap it to 80 or fewer characters per line. A C program
that can be used to reformat papers before mailing (with carriage returns
inserted only at suitably chosen spaces) is available as reform.c. 


Uufiles

Uufiles automatically combines a group of files into one file (a .tar file),
compresses it (making it a .tar.gz file) and uuencodes it (converting the
binary .gz file into a text file, so that it can be transmitted by e-mail).
All you need to do is install uufiles as an executable, run it, and type in
the file names.

To download the unix version, get uufiles via the e-mail interface
(also available in papers/macros via anon ftp, or click here).
To install it, just save it in a directory on your PATH and then
type chmod 755 uufiles to make it executable.

To download and and install versions on other platforms, see the
corresponding section in our uufaq:

Unix
VMS (VAX and Alpha)
PCs
Macs


To use uufiles, just run it (e.g. on unix, just type uufiles).
It will prompt you for the files you wish to include. Be sure to specify 
only the files that you want to include in the package; we have had
people send their entire home directories to us. uufiles prints out the
list of files it is including in the package, so check this list to make
sure it is what you intended. 

The result will be a file ending in .uu . This contains your entire submission.
To submit it to the archive using e-mail, append it after the title and
abstract you prepared following the instructions in the preparation help.
Then mail this file to arch-ive@arXiv.org, where arch-ive is the archive
on which you want it to appear (e.g. hep-th).

If uufiles does not work, it is possible that
you need various utilities (notably tar, gzip
[or compress], and uuencode) to be installed.


Multiple files without uufiles

Multiple files should never be concatenated together so that they
have to be cut apart by hand. Rather, all the files should be tarred together,
gzipped, and uuencoded and submitted as a single package via put.
(See utilities.txt for more information on tar, gzip and uuencode.)
To facilitate automatic processing, tar the files so that they unpack in the
current directory rather than a subdirectory (and users should always unpack
others' submissions in a subdirectory to avoid overwriting their own files).
Or, using fput, multiple files can be deposited individually via ftp and
picked up via a single fput command (packaging will be done by the archive
server automatically), or you can deposit a gzipped tar file (no uuencoding
necessary for ftp, but remember to deposit using "binary" mode).

Figures should not be appended to the main file, nor should they ever be
concatenated together other than by tar. You should include your figures in
a single package with your TeX file as if they were style files, following
the directions above (preferably as a .uu file made with
uufiles). Individual figures ordinarily shouldn't be larger than 300kB and
your whole package should be under 650 kB; if not read sizes.txt).


Postscript or PDF submissions

If you wrote in TeX, you should be submitting the TeX. Otherwise, the
PostScript or PDF needs to be gzipped and uuencoded for sending through
e-mail for put. It is best to use uufiles to do
this; see above or the uufaq for more
info. Alternatively, you can put either the raw PostScript or PDF or the
gzipped PostScript file using fput.  Be sure to use
binary mode. DO NOT send raw PostScript via e-mail since it breaks when
random line breaks are introduced (reform.c cannot wrap PostScript properly).

 Note that single PostScript files that are gzipped and uuencoded are
unpacked by the server automatically so that they are directly available
via the World Wide Web interface. Any comments that you put at the top of
any uuencoded file will be lost.

The reason for the special handling of PDF is because end-of-line
characters on different platforms are different.  Unix uses just a ^J
(i.e. octal \012) while PC's use ^M^J (i.e. \015\012). Some mailers perform an
automatic translation between the two and this affects the byte-count, in turn
used in a PDF file to index the locations of "objects" in the table of
contents. PDF viewers will reconstruct the table of contents if a problem is
detected, but this can be slow.


Mailer weirdness

Many mail routers expect only 7-bit ASCII characters so you cannot
include 8-bit ASCII characters in your e-mail messages (either in your TeX
source, or in your Title/Author/Abstract information). 8-bit ASCII
characters usually come from European authors who have to use accented
characters, or from typing an invisible character accidentally in an
editor. An indication that you have sent 8-bit ASCII is that your abstract
(and whatever else you sent) has been systematically "corrupted" by hex
encodings preceded by = signs (e.g. =20). This is because your mailer
switched to "printed quotable" mode to avoid sending 8-bit characters.  You
must replace your paper if this happens because most people will be unable
to invert the encoding. Authors who need to type accented characters should
use the TeX representation for the character (e.g. \'e).

Authors should also be careful to avoid certain curiosities of Unix mailers.
For example, any line beginning with the word `From' will automatically
be converted to >From (resulting in an upside down question mark
in the TeX'ed paper). This can be avoided either by adding a space or using
{}From.  Similarly a ~ at the beginning of a line (for authors who mistakenly
prefer inserting multiple ~'s instead of \quad's or \qquad's for spacing) is
interpreted as an escape sequence by Unix mailers and will confuse them.
Solution again is to insert space or use {}~. A line that begins with a period
and is otherwise blank is interpreted as an EndOfFile by Unix mailers and
should also be avoided (it is not obvious why this would ever happen in TeX
source, but it has). reform.c will fix some of these problems.

It would be helpful if authors burdened with IBM mainframes that still use
non-standard conventions for symbols such as
     {,},|,~,^ = left/right curly brackets, vertical bar, tilde, caret
could make the necessary translation before submitting. (Happily, since 
this was written in '91, the insipid EBCDIC machines are almost all gone.)

Finally, although MIME mail is becoming widespread, we do not currently
accept MIME formatted submissions. Please send any attachments for your paper
in the manner described above, and not as MIME attachments.
