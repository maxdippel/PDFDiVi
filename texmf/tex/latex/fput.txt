Instructions for Anonymous ftp Submissions

Papers can be submitted to the archive via anonymous ftp.
First, read the general instructions in our submit help, and prepare
your title and abstract as described in title/abstract preparation. 
Anonymous fput submission is particularly useful for people who have limits
on the size of their outgoing e-mail, or who have large submissions.

It is a two step process: first deposit the `body' parts via anonymous ftp
to ftp://arXiv.org/incoming , and
then send an e-mail message with the names of the files and the title and
abstract of the paper. We describe the procedure below. Note that fput only
works on the main archive server arXiv.org, and not any of the mirrors
such as babbage.sissa.it.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
fput filename1 .... filenameN
freplace paper# filename1 ... filenameN
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Your paper (usually the tex file), figures, and any other files for your 
paper should be put in the incoming sub-directory:
              ftp arXiv.org
              cd incoming
              put mypaper.tex
              put myfigs.tar.gz

(The filenames mypaper.tex and myfigs.tar.gz used here are meant to be
descriptive: you are free to use any number of files and any filenames you
please, but see below.)

In place of the two separate put commands above, you can also use mput:
              mput mypaper.tex myfigs.tar.gz
       
-- but note that  "put file1 file2" will not work properly: it will instead
deposit your file1 remotely as file2.

After transferring your files, you then send an e-mail message with your
abstract:
      To: arch-ive@arXiv.org
      Subject: fput mypaper.tex myfigs.tar.gz
To replace some paper, e.g. arch-ive/9401001, use
      To: arch-ive@arXiv.org
      Subject: freplace 9401001 mypaper.tex myfigs.tar.gz


The formatting of the abstract in the body of the `fput' or `freplace' e-mail
message is identical to that of the `put' or `replace' command. For a complete
description of this format, read the help text prep.txt,
available via `get'.
Because you have already sent the files using ftp, however, nothing has to be
put after the third and final \\ that delineates the end of your abstract.

The arguments to the fput/frep command are the filename(s) of the files
that you `put' with anonymous ftp. There can be more than one filename.
You must specify the exact filename(s) that were used in the ftp session.
Case does not matter in determining the files in the incoming directory,
but the case of the filenames used in the `fput' command is important
(e.g., file.z and file.Z as arguments to `fput' will both match up with
file.z or file.Z on the incoming directory, but the files will be stored
with whatever was used in the `fput' e-mail message).
To avoid unnecessary confusion, we strongly urge use of the standard filename
extensions. A list of these is given in
utilities.txt, available via `get'.

There is considerable flexibility in how you choose to put the various
files that make up your paper onto the archive using fput. You can put each
file individually, although this might conflict with others if you use file
names like fig1.ps . Your files will be packaged correctly by the server
automatically. This option is therefore a good one if you can't manage to get
tar, gzip, and uuencode installed on your system (although you should
still install them since you will need them to read other submissions on the
archives).

Another approach is to use tar or uufiles to package up your files.
A tar file can be compressed using either Unix LZW compress or, preferably
gzip.  You can then put the .uu, .tar.Z or .tar.gz file (.taz and .tgz on
some systems) in the /incoming sub-directory. By using this approach, you
can be sure that the files are unpacked with the correct names.
(Be sure to use binary mode when transferring .tar, .gz or .Z files.)
Get eput.txt for more information.
            
When using ftp to put files into the incoming directory, you should
do an `ls' to list the files already there, and be sure to use names
for your files that don't clash with ones already there. Generic filenames
such as `paper.tex' or `fig1.eps' should be avoided since it is
more likely that someone else would also use this name. Filenames should also
be short to keep the subject line of the `fput' message short.
      

---------------------------------------------------------------------
freplace paper# filename1 ... filenameN

Use this to replace a paper. The e-mail message should contain
the same information as that of an `fput' message (i.e., be sure to include
a full abstract). The format is identical to that of the `fput' command,
except that the paper number needs to be the FIRST argument.
The rest of the arguments are the names of the files.
---------------------------------------------------------------------

fput/frep examples:

      1)  Ordinary, simple paper with no auxiliary files
     
      ftp arXiv.org (DO NOT USE telnet!)
      login: anonymous
      passwd: your@mail.address
      ftp> cd incoming
      ftp> ls (make sure your filenames don't clash with what is there.)
      ftp> binary 
           (necessary if transferring non-ascii files between a non-Unix
            machine and arXiv.org which is a Unix machine.)

      ftp> put paper.tex smithpaper.tex 
           (this changes the local name to an appropriate remote name.)
      ftp> ls (make sure you see your submission.)
      
Now send e-mail to the appropriate archive address:

To: arch-ive@arXiv.org  (change ``arch-ive'' to the desired archive name)
Subject: fput smithpaper.tex

      2)  Replace paper hep-th/9401001 with paper and five figures that
          have been put into myfigs.tar.gz file:

      ... << as in example (1) above until "ftp> put" line >>
      ftp> put mypaper.tex 
      ftp> put myfigs.tar.gz
      ftp> ls (make sure you see your submission.)

Now send e-mail to the appropriate archive address, in this case hep-th:

To: hep-th@arXiv.org
Subject: freplace 9401001 mypaper.tex myfigs.tar.gz
