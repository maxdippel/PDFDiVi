Question 1: I cannot find the macro package I am looking for

This list is just a selection of the frequently used macros.

If a macro package doesn't appear here, you can get it from the Comprehensive
TeX Archive Network (CTAN at http://www.ctan.org/).

CTAN should be your primary source for macros.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 2: I want to submit a macro package which is missing from the list

We are not actively updating this list. See question 1 above.

Check whether your macro package is available on CTAN. If it isn't then you
can upload the macro package to CTAN. When you have done that then you should
mail us with the location.

Remember that you can bundle specific macro packages and style files with your
submission to get it online. To do this, just include the extra file(s) in
the tar file or upload list.
