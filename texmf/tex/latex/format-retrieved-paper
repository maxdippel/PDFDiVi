Format of Retrieved Papers 

	Although papers can be submitted in various formats, the
preferred format is TeX or LaTeX papers.  If the paper is lengthy, the
figures are submitted as tar-compressed postscript files. Look for a
section in the received file that begins with 

	#!/bin/csh -f
	# Note: this uuencoded compressed tar

which start the figure portion of the file. 

	If you use anonymous ftp to get the paper, you may see several
files for the same paper.  The paper#.1 is the text file; paper#.2 is
the file of figures.

	When you ``get'' a paper from the database via forms, all files 
pertaining to the paper will be concantenated and placed in one file on 
your disk.  If you ``get'' a paper via email or the www server, the 
concantenated paper will be sent to you.

The example below is of a concantenated file.  The files which you
retrieve via anonymous ftp will not of course have the garbage between
the text of the paper and the figure portion.

  garbage

#!/bin/csh -f
# Note: this uuencoded compressed tar file created by csh script uufiles
# if you are on a unix machine this file will unpack itself:
# just strip off any mail header and call resulting file, e.g., figures.uu
# (uudecode will ignore these header lines and search for the begin line below)
# then say        csh figures.uu
# if you are not on a unix machine, you should explicitly execute the commands:
#    uudecode figures.uu;   uncompress figures.tar.Z;   tar -xvf figures.tar
#
uudecode $0
chmod 644 figures.tar.Z
zcat figures.tar.Z | tar -xvf -
rm $0 figures.tar.Z

How to Transform the file 
-------------------------

This pertains to the example above, a LaTeX text file, with an appended
file of postscript figures.
	
	 Strip off the email message lines down to the
		``\documentstyle'' line.
	 Separate the text portion of the document into its
		own file.  The text portion is the portion between
		the ``\documentstyle'' line and the ``\end{document}''
		line.
	 LaTeX the text file created above.  
	 Strip off the garbage from the figure file.
	 Follow the instructions which make up the header of the
		figure file.  Note:  uufiles is a script which is
		available by using the ``get uufiles'' command through
		email.
	

If Retrieval Doesn't Work 
-------------------------

If the retrieved paper does not have the format described above and you
need help in converting the text to postscript or in translating the
figures,  send email to one of the following:
