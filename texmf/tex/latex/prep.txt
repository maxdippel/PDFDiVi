Title and Abstract Preparation

This help document explains how to format your title and abstract. After
you have completed this part, get our submit help
to learn how to submit your paper.

The abstract and title of your paper will be e-mailed to hundreds or
thousands of your colleagues, and accessible to even more via our web
interface. In order to categorize information and to present a consistent
'look and feel' to the archives, we have adopted a specific format for the
author-submitted titles and abstracts.
Papers should be submitted with a single extra copy of title, authors,
comments, local report number and abstract.
For web uploads, you will fill out a form with entries for each.
For ftp or e-mail submissions, prepare a file in the following format
(be sure to include the \\'s to separate the sections --
the information between the first two \\'s will be stripped off
for use in notifications of papers received and listings):

\\
Title: Recent Seminal Results That Take One or More Lines to Describe 
  Succinctly Even with Compactification and No Blank Lines
Authors: Author One, Author Two, 
   Authors ad infinitum (affiliations if desired belong in parentheses, 
   but don't include full snail mail addresses) 
Comments: 12 pages, TeX (or Latex, etc), special macros if any, other comments,
   mpeg simulations available at ftp://myhost.domain/path/file.mpg
   or at http://myhost.mydomain/RSR/file.mpg
Report-no: EFI-94-11
Subj-class: (only for physics and cond-mat archives) Primary Subject from list;
  Secondary Subject(s) from list (if desired)
Journal-ref: Obsc. Unr. Jour. 51 (1994) 87-95
\\
  Your abstract (or other short description; abstract must be shorter than 24
lines or it will be automatically truncated -- avoid unnecessary blank lines.
Similarly Title/Author/etc header fields above should be under 11 lines).
This abstract is used only for the listings and is not TeXed, so avoid 
unnecessary TeX such as font commands or mysterious \cite{} references. 
The Report-no above is your local preprint number. The Journal-ref is a 
complete bibliographic reference including volume and page number, only to
be used if the paper has already appeared in a journal. The Journal-ref 
can be added later using the `published' command or via the web upload. 
References like "to appear..." or "to be published..." belong in the
Comments: field. For a complete description of the ideally formatted
abstract, see below.
\\
If submitting by e-mail, your submission would follow here,
packaged as directed in eput.txt.
For fput, nothing should be attached here. 


Abstracts are reformatted during the put process, so it is important to
adhere to the format. The script that does the processing tries to correct
for common mistakes, but they are preferably avoided entirely.
The most important reformatting is line-wrapping to 80 characters. This is
preferable for most abstracts, but there are occasions when lines shouldn't be
wrapped together, e.g. if the abstract is a table of contents. To allow for
this, lines with leading white space are not wrapped. Thus, you should not
submit an abstract that contains leading white space unless you explicitly
prefer no wrapping.

Don't include any extra fields that aren't listed above. They will just
be wrapped incorrectly. If a field doesn't apply to your paper, omit it
altogether (but you must have a Title: and Authors: field,
and Comments: fields are highly recommended).

When you put your submission, you will receive a response that includes
a copy of your abstract EXACTLY as it would appear in the next mailing.
READ THIS RESPONSE. It has much important information in it.
If there are any problems with it, replace your paper and correct your mistakes
before they cause undue embarrassment to colleagues, friends, and/or family.
Replaces on the same day as a put do not result in an additional date
stamp, so there is no harm in correcting your abstract using replace.
If you have questions or suspect a problem, send a comment using the comment
command, or by sending mail to www-admin@arXiv.org. 
DO NOT send files via comment or to www-admin unless explicitly requested.


Helpful Hints


The Title: Field

 Do not use all upper case letters.
 Omit useless TeX directives like \bf or extra $'s - titles are meant to be
    human readable, e.g. $N\!=\!2$ should simply be N = 2.
 Expand out TeX macros that are mystifying, e.g. "Nonlinear Sigma Models"
    instead of "\nlsm".
 Check your spelling.


The Authors: Field

 In order to automate indexing and searching, it is necessary for
    authors to be listed in a canonical format. The rule is that all 
    names should be given in the order, Firstname Lastname or Firstname 
    Middlename Lastname (where Lastname is your family name).

      Multiple author names should be separated with a comma

        E. L. Grossman, T. Zhou, E. Ben-Naim

      or with the word "and",

        Michael Dine, Yosef Nir and Yuri Shirman

      First names and middle names can be abbreviated with just an initial.
      Initials should be followed by a period and then a space.
      Do not use all upper case letters for names.

      If an author's name cannot fit into this format (for example if it
    contains the word "and" or if commas are used to separate parts of a name,
    such as  in Bill Gates, Jr) then you must contact www-admin@arXiv.org
    to obtain the more detailed rules for these circumstances.


 If you wish to include author affiliations, put them in parentheses. Do
    not put a full mailing address. At most, include a city and country 
    (no zip (postal) codes or street addresses). 
    If you have several authors from the same institution, you can use a
    footnote style for the affiliations. Here is an example (be sure to do
    it in the form presented here, including all parentheses):

     Authors: Author One (1), Author Two (1 and 2), Author Three (2)
       ((1) Institution One, (2) University Two)


 Collaborations should use the collaboration name. If individual
    author names are included, be careful that it is not too long, or the
    list can be truncated. The preferred format is
      Authors: MILC Collaboration: Author One, Author Two,...


The Comments: Field

 Indicate number of pages and number of figures. If desired, include
    Tex flavor or related comments. Don't bother to put "uuencoded" or
    "gzipped tar file" even if you submitted it this way.

 Anonymous ftp and World Wide Web locations should be given in 
    the standard Uniform Resource Locator (URL) format. The archive's WWW
    interface automatically translates an ftp URL into an active link reading
    "this ftp URL" and an http URL into a link reading "this http URL"
    (try for a grammatically sensible substitution). Also, you should add a
    space to separate any periods or text following a URL from the URL itself,
    so that it is not interpreted as part of the URL.
    The location of related files or information should be given here.
    For example, the comment
       "for associated mpeg file, see http://myhost.domain/file.mpg"
    when accessed via www pages at arXiv.org views as
       "for associated mpeg file, see <this URL>" .

 References to other papers on the other archives should be given in
    the standard arch-ive/yymmnnn format so that our Web interface can
    turn the reference into a link to the paper's abstract.

 This is the proper field for "to be published in" or "submitted to"
    information

 If this is a replacement, indicate the nature of the replacement and the
    severity of the changes so readers will know why it was replaced. Remember
    to still include your original comments (e.g. number of pages), because
    the comments field is not cumulative.


The Report-no: Field

 Put in your institution's locally assigned publication number

 Do not put any other information in this field;
    leave the field blank if your institution does not supply these.
 Note that the Report-no above is purely illustrative --
    any resemblance to that of real papers,
    submitted or withdrawn, is purely coincidental.

The Subj-class: Field

This field is for physics and cond-mat archives. For the physics archive,
you must include an entry from this list; for the cond-mat archive
it is optional to include one from this list.
(By e-mail, send a "help" command to the archive in question.)
Here is an example:
Subj-class: Biological Physics

Multiple subject classifications within the submission archive, if desired,
are semi-colon separated (Subj-class: Biological Physics; Chemical Physics).
At a later time, you can always cross-list 
to additional subject classes (in the same or other archives).


The Journal-ref: Field

This field is only for a full bibliographic reference if the paper has
    already appeared in a journal or a proceedings
Indicate the volume number, year, and page number
If your submission hasn't appeared yet, but you would still like to
    indicate where it will be published, use the Comments: field
If at a later date you want to add a Journal-ref:, use the published
     command. (You can also use the web interface, if you have the password
you were sent after your submission.)



The Abstract

Do not include the word "Abstract" (or any of its common misspellings)
This version of the abstract is used only for the listings and is not TeXed.
As with the title, expand out opaque TeX macros and remove extraneous
    TeX directives. For example, including TeX formatting commands such as
    ~ \, (backslash comma) and \  (backslash space) -- which represent spacing 
    -- does not improve readability. Omit them. Also omit font commands such
    as \em and \it.
Do not start lines with whitespace (spaces, tabs, etc.) unless you are
    trying to prevent our automatic line wrapping. You might choose to use
    leading whitespace if for example your abstract is a table of contents.
    Avoid unnecessary blank lines. 
Keep it short -- abstracts longer than about 20 lines will be truncated;
    abridge your abstract if necessary. The whole abstract between the
    second and third \\'s should not be longer than 24 80-character lines
    so that it can be displayed on a VT100 terminal.






Here is a template of the abstract format (if you use it, don't leave
in the <'s and >'s):

\\
Title: <title of paper with no blank lines>
Authors: <list of authors (parenthetical optional affiliations)>
Comments: <comments, including number of pages, type of TeX, special
  macros if any> 
Report-no: <optional report number as assigned by your institution>
Journal-ref:<optional journal reference, ONLY if already published>
\\
    <Abstract of the paper (or other short description).>
\\

And here is an example:

\\
Title: Recent Seminal Results in the Theory of Everything
  that I have been Working on Recently
Authors: Sew-Soo Mee (Eastern Fundamental Institute) and Ahl-Sioux Yoo
  (Eschatological Fantasies, Inc.)
Comments: 12 pages, 3 Postscript figures, uses rotate.sty
Report-no: EFI-94-11
Journal-ref: Obsc. Unr. Jour. 51 (1994) 87-95
\\
  This paper explains everything about everything, thereby making redundant
all other papers in the field.  Applications to text compression should
be obvious.
