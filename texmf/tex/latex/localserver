                    Local Bulletin Board Software
                   written 1992 by Andreas Honecker
             Physikalisches Institut der Universit\"at Bonn

FEATURES

The software we are going to describe was first written, installed
and tested in Bonn in order to provide automatic recording of
present hep-th papers for reasons of cost reduction. Now it offers
many features:

* A copy of the `get' command. If people send their `get's to the local
  server rather than to the big one all requested papers are recorded.
  If a paper is already present, people are informed.
  Papers which are requested for the first time are fetched from the big
  server and forwarded to the person who requested it. We felt that this is
  the only sensible way to prevent multiple printing of papers because people
  do not see much difference and nobody has to worry about what papers have
  already been printed. The advantages are cost reduction and problems when
  TeXing papers have to be solved only once.
* Local abstract distribution with automated subscription and signoff.
* All incoming abstracts are collected and stored. People who have e.g. been
  absent may request the listing of collected abstracts and read them at a
  piece.
* Maintenance of a list of group members. This faciliates announcements of
  events of local importance like e.g. seminars.
* Local search in the complete abstracts. If one is looking for a subject
  rather than authors or preprint numbers this should be a major improvement
  compared to the `find' commands provided by the bulletin boards.
* Some people frequently need the helpfile for the bulletin board. Therefore,
  it is stored locally and automatically available on request.
* The present software also provides several auxiliary commands which are
  related to the above tasks. It also provides a simple means to announce
  changes in the software to the users.

The software operates in a manner similar to the `big' bulletin boards:
It reacts to commands given in the subject field of a mail.
We are not going to describe the commands here - the distribution includes
a helpfile `help' which we recommend to consult for details.

In order to be able to run this software you need an account
on a UNIX workstation. If not abnormal many commands are performed
it will not use more than a few seconds CPU time per day.

AVAILABILITY

The software for this server is free. The original distribution
comes from an anonymous FTP server the internet address of which is

                 avzw02.physik.uni-bonn.de
                     (131.220.221.111)

The  file `hepthserver/hepthserver.tar.Z' contains the complete
distribution.

==============================================================
NEW FEATURES (1 Feb '93):

* All new hep-th - papers and replaced papers are fetched
  via FTP and stored locally. Thus, one can `get' papers
  even if internet connections do not work properly.
* A fast interactive mode of the server has been added.
* In the interactive mode, front end capabilities for
  figure extraction, TeXing and printing of papers
  (all fully automated) have been added. This works
  with all papers that are stored locally.
* A prompt abstract distribution is ensured by fetching
  the abstracts via FTP if they do not arrive at the
  usual time via mail (at most 1/2 hour delay).

In summary, local abstract distribution and getting
papers is now more reliable and much more convenient than
using the big bulletin boards. Therefore, you should use
the local bulletin board.

Introduction:
-------------

TeXing and printing papers from the Ginsparg-System
hep-th is not only a nasty task (at least when there
are problems), but it should also be avoided because
it is too expensive.

This system intends to make it manageable to receive
and print papers from HEPTH only once. Instead of
sending your requests for papers to italy or the US
(which is anyway forbidden) you just send the
'get'-commands to:

     hepth@avzw02.physik.uni-bonn.de

You will either receive a message who already has the
paper or - like usual - the paper.
In urgent case (really URGENT) you can of course
get papers directly from the US or italy.

Furthermore, you can receive daily hep-th - abstracts
using this mail server, send messages to all members
of the group, read old abstracts ... more will be
explained below.

ALL new hep-th papers are now via FTP and
stored temporarily in Bonn. This make automated
TeXing, previewing, and printing (including figures)
possible. It also increases our independence from
working internet connections. `get' s are processed
immediately if the paper is stored in Bonn!


commands are entered in the Subject field (like the
servers in italy or the US).
The following commands are currently implemented:

'get'  requests the hepth-preprints which follow this
       command. Our software is currently restricted
       to SEVEN digits for preprint numbers. For every
       get you get exactly one answer. This tells you
       who already has the paper or that it is being
       requested (and where).
       EXAMPLE:
               get 9207072 9209004
       NOTE: Cross-Listed papers must be requested
       directly from the bulletin board where they
       are stored.
'unget' With 'unget' you can remove a paper which you
       have requested but actually do not have because
       you did not like it, it was unTeXable or ...
       'unget' accepts a single SEVEN digit argument
       containing the paper number.
       NOTE: Of course, it does not make sense to
       unget papers that you actually do have.
'abstracts yymm' requests a list of all abstracts we
       stored for the month mm in the year yy.
       Messages about news and replaced papers are
       not stored.
       EXAMPLE:
               abstracts 9208
'list' in the Subject-field sends you a list of all
       hepth-papers that have been printed in Bonn.
'help' With 'help' you receive the original
       hepth-help file in addition to this message.
'distribute' distributes the contents of this mail
       to all members of our group. This command is
       perfectly well suited for announcements of
       seminars and similar purposes.
'group' sends you a list of all email-addresses that
       will receive a mail via the 'distribut'-command.
'daily' sends you a list of all those email-addresses
       that receive daily hep-th - abstracts.
'subscribe' With this command you can tell our local
       server that you wish to receive daily
       hepth-abstracts.
'signoff' You may tell our local hepth-server that
       you do not want to receive daily abstracts
       any more by sending a mail with subject
       'signoff'. We store all abstracts (without
       news and replaced papers) and you are able
       to get them for reading. Therefore we
       strongly recommend to signoff also in case
       of longer absence. This will hold your mail
       more short.
'comment' This command gives you the opportunity
       to report bugs, wishes, comments and so on
       to the operator. Only mails with a Subject
       'comment' will be read by a human being.
       Therefore do not misuse this command.
'stat' returns a statistics of who has how many
       papers. Try that regularly in order to find
       out if you 'get' abnormal many papers.
'find' The command 'find' searches ALL COMPLETE
      abstracts for a token. Use as:
         Subject: find token
      Of course, this means that we now have ALL
      hep-th abstracts starting August 1991.
      The adavantage of our local find should be
      that you can search for "Stichworte" in the
      complete abstracts. Of course, the result
      also contains the complete abstracts.
      Please do not make excessive use of this
      command because it uses considerable CPU-time
      (several seconds). This might disturb people
      using the workstation.

INTERACTIVE MODE:
On the workstations there also exists an interactive
mode providing all features of the server. Simply call
'hepth'. This mode should be self explanatory. The
interactive mode supports a further command:

`view' This command is intended to be used for
      automatic TeXing, figure extraction,
      previewing and printing of those papers
      which are stored in Bonn.
      First, figures which are appended as PostScript
      or a separate shell archive will be extracted.
      Then the format (TeX/LaTeX) is determined
      and the compiler run on the input file.
      If the compiler asks questsions, answer
      them like you are used to. Next, the previewer
      is called and you may decide if the paper is
      interesting.

      After quitting the previewer you will be
      asked if you would like to print the paper
      (of course only if it has not been printed
       yet). If you answer with 'y' it will
      be printed on the ELSA printer and registered
      on your account.



Should anybody want to be inserted into or deleted from
the list of members of our group, please sned the request
as a mail with Subject 'comment' to the server.

Every member of the group has a name. Should it be deleted
(for reasons of protection of your personal data) or is it
spelled incorrectly, please let us now as well using the
comment command.

In order to make photocopying of the papers easier we
have two wishes:
i)  Leave the paper 1 day (>= 24 hours) as it is:
    In particular no binding !
    If people come later on they are to blame
    themselves.
ii) Most papers do not yet print the hepth-number on
    the title page. In this case please write the
    number onto the title page. Later on, this will
    make identification of the paper simpler.

IMPORTANT:
If you do not fancy receiving this file permanently via
email, please make sure that no acknowledges are sent to
hepth@avzw02. People who are using GONE on the IBM3084
(also defined as mainframe) can achieve this by entering
        GONE (DONTANSWER HEPTH@*   .

Please send any complaints or suggestions not directly
to anybody -- rather use the comment command (the
operator might change some time). If you have
information on malfunctions please include time and
date. This will faciliate debugging.

WHY SHOULD YOU USE LOCAL ABSTRACT DISTRIBUTION ?

We make sure that everybody subscribed to local
abstract distribution gets his daily abstracts not
later than 08:45. If the abstracts have not arrived via
mail until 08:30 we try to get them from italy via FTP.
If we do not manage to get them from that place until
08:40 we try to get them from the US. If this fails as
well, there are really no abstracts available at that time.

However, currently there are still two disadvantages:
    1) If the abstracts arrive via mail later than 08:25
       you are probably going to get them twice.
    2) If there are no new abstracts at that time you
       may get the abstracts from the day before.



                         Automatically,
                         Your hepth-server

\leftline{\bf Features}
\line{\hrulefill}
\mn
The software we are going to describe was first written, installed
and tested in Bonn in order to provide automatic recording of
present hep-th papers for reasons of cost reduction. Now it offers
many features:
\item{$\bullet$} A copy of the {\it get} command. If people send
                 their {\it get}'s to the local server rather than
                 to the big one all requested papers are recorded.
                 If a paper is already present, people are informed.
                 Papers which are requested for the first time are
                 fetched from the big server and forwarded to the
                 person who requested it. We felt that this is
                 the only sensible way to prevent multiple
                 printing of papers because people do not see
                 much difference and nobody has to worry about
                 what papers have already been printed. The
                 advantages are cost reduction (photocopying is
                 cheaper) and problems when TeXing papers have to
                 be solved only once.
\item{$\bullet$} Local abstract distribution with automated
                 subscription and signoff.
\item{$\bullet$} All incoming abstracts are collected and stored.
                 People who have e.g.\ been absent may request
                 the listing of collected abstracts and read
                 them at a piece.
\item{$\bullet$} Maintenance of a list of group members. This
                 faciliates announcements of events of local
                 importance like e.g.\ seminars.
\item{$\bullet$} Local search in the complete abstracts. If one is
                 looking for a subject rather than authors or preprint
                 numbers this should be a major improvement compared
                 to the {\it find} commands provided by the bulletin boards.
\item{$\bullet$} Some people frequently need the helpfile for
                 the bulletin board. Therefore, it is stored locally
                 and automatically available on request.
\item{$\bullet$} The present software also provides several auxiliary
                 commands which are related to the above tasks.
                 It also provides a simple means to announce
                 changes in the software to the users.
\mn
The software operates in a manner similar to the `big' bulletin
boards: It reacts to commands given in the subject field of a
mail. We are not going to describe the commands here -- the
distribution includes a helpfile `help' which we recommend
to consult for details.
\medskip
In order to be able to run this software you need an account
on a UNIX workstation. If not abnormal many commands are performed
it will not use more than a few seconds CPU time per day.
\mn
{\bf Note:} The software is provided as is -- no liability
whatsoever is taken. However, it has been running nicely in
Bonn, Germany for several month.
\bn
\leftline{\bf Availability}
\line{\hrulefill}
\mn
The software for this server is free. The original distribution
comes from an anonymous FTP server the internet address of which
is
\sn
\centerline{avzw02.physik.uni-bonn.de}
\centerline{(131.220.221.111)}
\sn
The file `hepthserver/hepthserver.tar.Z' contains the complete
distribution.
\mn
You are free to change and redistribute the software if you
\item{(1)} Include all files of the original distribution.
\item{(2)} Clearly point out where the original version
           originates from.
\item{(3)} Clearly mark the changes you have made.
\bn
\leftline{\bf Installation}
\line{\hrulefill}
\mn
The contents of this and the following sections are meant
exclusively for the operator of the local server. It is
absolutely unnecessary for any user to read them.
The description is given in some detail. If you follow it
step by step it should be possible to install the
software in at most 1 hour.
\mn
This software needs a separate account on a UNIX workstation
because it reads and discards all e-mail on the account where
it is running. The name of the account should be meaningful.
We have a user `hepth' for management of hep-th preprints.
\medskip
First, you should subscribe to daily abstract distribution
from this account. You should also get yourself the original
helpfile form the bulletin board and save it in a file
called `originalhepthhelp'.
\medskip
The program is written entirely in ANSI-C and thus should run
on any UNIX system V. If possible, you should use the
GNU-C-Compiler GCC.
If you do not have this compiler, edit the `makefile'
and change the line `CC = gcc' to `CC = cc'.
\sn
The particularities of your local installation have to be defined
in the file `hepthserver.h'. Edit this file and change the
following definitions appropriately:
\mn
\leftline{\bf BOARDNAME}
The name of the bulletin board you perfom
local services for. If you use the software
for a different board than hep-th change this.
\mn
\leftline{\bf MAILTEMPLATE}
The directory where mail is stored on your
workstation. This must end with a `\%s'.
Hopefully, you will not have to change this definition.
\mn
\leftline{\bf HEPTHADDR}
e-mail address of the bulletin board where to
get the papers from.
\mn
\leftline{\bf OPERATOR}
e-mail address of person operating the local
board. This is used to send all comments to.
Please change this!
\mn
\leftline{\bf TOWN}
Description of the place where the software
is being run. This will have to be changed.
\mn
\leftline{\bf FIRSTABSTRACTS}
Year and month of the first abstracts
you have. The format is an integer of the form
`yymm'. This is necessary for the
{\it find} command. {\it find} terminates if it
fails to open an abstract file. Therefore,
make sure that this is set to the correct value.
\mn
\leftline{\bf PROTOCOL}
This is a switch indicating whether a protocol file
is to be created or not. If there is a
protocol file it has to be deleted from
time to time. Thus, if nobody is going to
look after the software, remove this
definition. However, we strongly recommend
to look after the software and to maintain
the protocol file (called `protocol') because
it helped us already frequently to detect
bugs of the software and failures of the
workstation (file system full $\ldots$).
\medskip
The documentation is contained in several files. They should
be edited in order to adapt e.g.\ the internet address to
the local one. The files are the following ones:
\mn
\leftline{\bf help}
The helpfile for the local server. This describes all
commands in detail. This file is sent to people
issuing invalid commands.
\mn
\leftline{\bf hepthhelp}
The helpfile which is sent on requests with {\it help}.
In our installation it contains the file `help' as
well as the original hep-th helpfile.
\mn
\leftline{\bf help1}
Message if a {\it get} with an illegal paper number is
issued. It should not be necessary to change this file.
\mn
\leftline{\bf helpabstracts}
If the {\it abstracts} command is not used properly
this file is sent as an introduction how to use the
command.
\mn
\leftline{\bf helpsub}
This message is sent to people who just have subscribed
to daily abstract distribution using the {\it subscribe}
command.
\mn
\leftline{\bf helpsign}
This file contains the message which is sent to anybody
who signs off from local abstract distribution.
\mn
\leftline{\bf comment}
If anybody makes a comment this file contains the
answer which is sent to him.
\mn
We use a special procedure to create the file `hepthhelp':
Concatenate the files `help', `originalhead' (date of the original
helpfile) and `originalhepthhelp' (original hep-th helpfile)
to the file `hepthhelp'. For this purpose there exists a
shell script called `makehelp'. Simply type:
\sn
\centerline{sh makehelp}
\medskip
In view of future updates we recommend not to make too many changes
and to inform us about errors in English spelling.
\medskip
The software needs further files as databases and a directory
called `abstracts'. The files it needs are `daily', `group', `news'
and `whohas'. There is a shell script `install' which will create
these files for you. Simply issue:
\sn
\centerline{sh install}
\mn
When running, the local server will create even further temporary
files which you should not mind.
\medskip
If you would like to have the complete collected abstracts for the
hep-th bulletin board starting August 1991 we offer to get them
from Bonn. You just have to send mails with subjects `abstracts 9108',
`abstracts 9109' and so on to
\sn
\centerline{hepth@avzw02.physik.uni-bonn.de}
\sn
and save them in files called `abstracts/9108', `abstracts/9109', $\ldots$.
\medskip
The software should be started in the background by typing
\sn
\centerline{hepthserver \&}
\sn
and you should be careful to keep the directory identical to that where
all auxiliary files are stored.
\medskip
As soon as the software runs properly it should be started automatically
after reboot of the machine. This can be achieved by asking your
system administrator to make an appropriate entry in the file
`/etc/rc'. Note that the userid has to be set to that of the special
account. Thus, a `su' is needed. For our server, there is an executable
file called `hepthscript' containing the commands:
\sn
\leftline{cd \~{}hepth}
\leftline{hepthserver \&}
\sn
and `rc' contains the following entry:
\sn
\centerline{su - hepth -c \~{}/hepth/hepthscript}
\bn
\leftline{\bf Maintenance}
\line{\hrulefill}
\mn
If you intend to change the databases of the local server
(the files `whohas', `daily' or `group') you will have to kill
the server software and restart it afterwards because it reads
the databases only when it is started.
\mn
The list of members of the group has to be maintained by the
operator. It is a simple ASCII-file called `group' which has
one entry per line of the form:
\sn
e-mail-address=Name in real life
\sn
e.g.:
\sn
unp06b@ibm.rhrz.uni-bonn.de=Andreas Honecker
\sn
Simply edit this file and make the appropriate changes.
Do not forget to kill and restart the server software after the
changes.
\mn
The database of people receiving daily abstracts `daily' is
even more simple: It contains just one e-mail address per
line. In principle, this file is maintained automatically.
\mn
Finally, the file `whohas' contains the description who has
which paper. This is also maintained automatically. However,
if you should want to make changes to it by hand we describe
the format here. Each paper is entered separately on a line.
The line starts with a 7 digit paper number followed by the
owner in curly brackets, e.g.:
\sn
9207072$\{$unp06b@ibm.rhrz.uni-bonn.de (Andreas Honecker)$\}$
\medskip
There is a simple way to announce changes in the software and
similar improvements to all users. For this purpose, there
is a file called `news' which contains these news. This file
is prepended to the daily abstracts file and appended to
the replies to {\it get} commands. The file `news' must
never be deleted. If there are no news, it should be
empty. We recommend to mark the boundaries of this file
clearly.
\mn
If the daily abstracts should not arrive or get lost it is possible
to fetch them via FTP and distribute them by hand. In fact,
the server detects incoming abstracts by the subject
`hep-th daily' (of course, `hep-th' replaced  by the name of the
bulletin board) followed by the first preprint number. If you send
a mail to your local server containing the abstracts and such a
subject it will be distributed like all other abstracts.
Be careful to include the proper preprint number because this is
used for storage of abstracts. Furthermore, we recommend to
indicate that abstracts were distributed by hand, and to check
the collected abstracts later.
\medskip
In the near future there will certainly be several updates of this
software. Therefore, I propose to anybody running this software
to register. Simply send a mail to the following e-mail-address
\mn
\centerline{UNP06B@IBM.RHRZ.UNI-BONN.DE}
\mn
telling me that your are running the local bulletin software.
Then, I will inform everybody if there are new versions and
what has been changed.
\mn
If you should have any problems with the software you may ask me for
help at the above e-mail address. Comments and proposals for future
changes are also welcome.
\bigskip
\mn
I would like to thank everybody using the hep-th server in Bonn
for many useful comments and encouragement. In particular, I would
like to thank Ralf H\"ubel for helping me with the software installation.
