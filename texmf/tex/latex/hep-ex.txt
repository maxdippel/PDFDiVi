Subject: Re: hep-ex cross-listings

Usage note on cross-listing from hep-ph to hep-ex:

Since the subject of the e-print archive hep-ph is elementary particle
phenomenology, any paper posted to hep-ph is potentially of interest to
experimentalists who post on hep-ex.  Thus, there is a strong tendency to
cross-list from hep-ph to hep-ex.  The "management" of the e-print archives
discourages such cross-listing.  The original reason for creating hep-ex as
a separate archive is that there are many more theoretical papers than
experimental papers, and so experimental papers need a haven from the
deluge of theory.  This purpose is defeated if excessive numbers of hep-ph
papers are cross-listed to hep-ex.

A paper should be cross-listed from hep-ph to hep-ex only if it falls 
in one of the following categories:
 1) The paper contains a nontrivial analysis of experimental data
    (e.g., a new fit to parton distribution functions).
 2) The paper concerns specifically the uses of theoretical results
    in experimental analysis (e.g., the announcement of a new Monte Carlo
    program for the radiative corrections to Bhabha scattering)
 3) The paper offers a specific criticism of an experimental analysis
    (e.g., a note pointing out that a certain radiative correction has
     been omitted in a paper posted to hep-ex)

The "management" thus recommends:
 1) That theorists cross-list to hep-ex only papers in the three categories
    above.
 2) That experimenters subscribe to hep-ph, thus removing the need for 
    cross-listing.
 3) That all users of the archive heap scorn upon authors who cross-list from
    hep-ph to hep-ex for the sole purpose of garnering extra publicity.
