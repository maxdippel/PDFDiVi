Abstract
We study the properties of the double-frequency sine–Gordon model in
the vicinity of the Ising quantum phase transition displayed by this model.
Using a mapping onto a generalised lattice quantum Ashkin-Teller model,
we obtain critical and nearly-off-critical correlation functions of various
operators. We discuss applications of the double-sine-Gordon model to
one-dimensional physical systems, like spin chains in a staggered external
field and interacting electrons in a staggered potential.

Introduction

The problem of determining the asymptotic behaviour of a conformal field theory
(CFT) under the action of a relevant operator is well studied and understood,
1

also in view of its relation to the physics of many quantum one-dimensional (1D)
and classical two-dimensional (2D) models. A less studied case concerns a CFT
perturbed by two relevant operators. Namely, consider a CFT subjected to such
relevant perturbation, gO∆g , with scaling dimension ∆g < 2, that turns it into
a fully massive quantum field theory (QFT). Then add another relevant perturbation, λO∆λ , which, if acting alone, would also make our QFT fully massive.
Although this is not as common situation as the previous one, we will show that
it displays interesting features which may be realized in physical systems.
Without loss of generality, we assume that ∆λ < ∆g < 2, i.e. that the second
perturbation is more relevant then the first one. Moreover, we shall require, for
the time being, that the operator product expansion (OPE) of these two operators
is closed in the sense that it does not produce other relevant operators. The most
general case will be discussed in a separate section. Then, the naïve expectation,
which prevailed until recently, is that no qualitative changes occur in this case
with respect to the standard situation of a CFT perturbed by a single relevant
operator: the low-energy behaviour of the theory would be governed by the most
relevant operator and, at any rate, the theory would remain fully massive. This
expectation is however not a general rule if the two operators exclude each other,
that is, if the field configurations which minimise one perturbation term do not
minimise the other. In this case, the interplay between the two competing relevant
operators can produce a novel quantum phase transition between two massive
QFT’s through a critical (massless) point. It is intuitively clear that such a
scenario is only conceivable if the ratio of the bare coupling constants, |g/λ|, is
large enough.

Recently Delfino and Mussardo (DM)[1] considered the double-frequency sineGordon (DSG) model, which is a Gaussian model of a scalar field Φ, perturbed by
two relevant vertex operators with the ratio of their scaling dimensions ∆g /∆λ =
4. The Hamiltonian density of the DSG model reads:
HDSG [Φ] = H0 [Φ] + U[Φ]
U[Φ] = −g cos βΦ(x) − λ sin[(β/2)Φ(x)].

(1)

where
i

h

H0 [Φ] = v0 (∂x φR )2 + (∂x φL )2 ,

(2)

φR,L being the chiral components of the Bose field, Φ = φR + φL. DM have shown
that there exists a quantum critical line λ = λc (g) where the DSG model displays
an Ising criticality with central charge c = 1/2.
2

The purpose of this paper is to investigate in detail the critical properties
of this transition and to discuss physical applications to spin chains and other
quantum one-dimensional (1D) systems. While we shall concentrate on the DSG
model in what follows, it should be noted that the phenomenon is more general similar quantum phase transitions do happen in more complicated models; those
shall be addressed elsewhere [2].
Apart from the practical interest in physical realizations of the DSG model,
this problem is of relevance also from a pure theoretical point of view. Indeed, we
have already mentioned that the Ising critical point separates two strong-coupling,
massive phases; hence, by definition, its analytical description is outside the range
of applicability of perturbation theory. In this paper we propose a nonperturbative scheme, which is essentially based on the mapping of the DSG model onto
another equivalent model – a generalised quantum Ashkin-Teller model on a 1D
lattice, where the Ising critical point becomes accessible.
The paper is organised as follows. In section 2 we briefly discuss the DSG
model at the semi-classical level and outline our approach to tackle the Ising
criticality in the vicinity of the decoupling point β 2 = 4π. In sections 3–5 we
present a complete description of the critical properties of the DSG model at
the Ising transition. In section 3 we introduce a quantum lattice version of a
generalised AT model which, apart from the conventional marginal inter-chain
coupling, also includes a ‘magnetic filed’ type of interaction, hσ1 σ2 . We show
that, in the continuum limit, this model is equivalent to the DSG model at
β 2 ∼ 4π. In section 4 we employ a new (σ-τ ) representation of the deformed AT
model which enables us to correctly identify those degrees of freedom that become

critical. In section 5 we use the results of the quantum-spin-chain mappings to
determine the physical properties of the DSG model close to the criticality.
In the next two sections we discuss applications of the DSG model to physical
systems. In particular, we discuss Ising transitions in a spontaneously dimerized
S=1/2 antiferromagnetic chain in a staggered magnetic field (section 6), and in
the 1D Hubbard model with a staggered potential (section 7). In section 8 we
show that at β 2 < 2π the second-order Ising transition may transform to a firstorder one. Section 9 contains discussion of the results and conclusions.
The paper is supplied with four Appendices which provide some details concerning bosonization of products of order and disorder operators for a system of
two identical Ising models, the relationship between the quantum AT model and
lattice fermions, a mean-field treatment of the σ-τ model, and calculation of the
3

correlation functions.

The model and its quasi-classical analysis

In this paper we will be dealing with the particular version of the DSG model (1)
corresponding to the case g > 0. We will also assume that λ > 0, although its
sign is unimportant due to the obvious symmetry Φ → −Φ.

For 2π < β 2 < 8π the Gaussian model is perturbed by two relevant vertex

operators closed under the OPE [1]. The existence of the Ising phase transition
can be qualitatively understood via a quasi-classical analysis: inspecting the profile of the potential U(Φ) as a function of the ratio x = λ/4g. At x = 0 one has a

periodic potential of a single-frequency sine-Gordon (SG) model. For x 6= 0 the

period of the potential is doubled in such a way that in the region 0 < x < 1
it can be viewed as a sequence of double-well potentials with the local structure

AΦ2 + BΦ4 , where A < 0, B > 0. Precisely at x = 1 each local double-well potential transforms to a Φ4 one (A = 0), and (in the Ginzburg–Landau sense) this
is a signature of the Ising criticality with the central charge c = 1/2. It should
be stressed that the double-well structure of the potential U(Φ) only occurs for
g > 0. Hence the Ising critical point only exist for positive g. The case of g < 0 is
qualitatively different: here the λ-perturbation removes the degeneracy between
neighbouring minima of cos βΦ and thus leads to soliton confinement (similarly
to the analysis in Ref[3]). The spectrum in this case always remains massive.
Thus, for model (1) with g > 0, a plausible scenario is that the relevant perturbations naturally act on the two constituent Ising models of the starting Gaussian
model, leaving one of them massless on the critical line λ = λc (g). (Quasiclassically λc (g) = 4g. A better estimation which takes into account quantum
fluctuations yields a power law λc (g) ∼ g ν , where ν = (32π − β 2 ) / (16π − β 2 )).

Indeed, DM have argued that the Ising transition is a universal property of the
DSG model (1) as long as β 2 < 8π. This makes it possible to consider the vicinity
of the point β 2 = 4π where the description of the transition greatly simplifies.
Namely, it is well known[4, 5] that β 2 = 4π is the decoupling (or Luther-Emery)
point of the ordinary SG model (λ = 0), at which the latter is equivalent to a
theory of free massive fermions. The scaling dimension 1/4 of the λ-term in (1)
indicates that this point is special for the DSG model as well, suggesting an Ising
model interpretation. In this paper we shall be working in the vicinity of the
decoupling point. Rescaling the field Φ, the DSG model can be written in an
4

equivalent form:

√
√
√
where v = (v0 /2)(β/ 4π+ 4π/β) and γ = (v0 / 4πβ)(β 2 −4π). It was originally
noted by DM that this form of the DSG model can be related to a deformed 2D
Ashkin–Teller (AT) model, which can be viewed as the standard AT model, i.e. a
model of two marginally coupled 2D Ising models with order parameters σ1 and
σ2 , extended to include a magnetic field type coupling, λσ1 σ2 . DM then argued
that, in the strong-coupling limit (λ → ∞), the system effectively reduces to
a single Ising model which may become critical if the temperature is properly

tuned to its critical value. This argument can be extended to finite values of λ,
provided that the two Ising copies are originally in a disordered phase, and thus
explains the existence of a critical line in the t-λ plane (t = (T − Tc )/Tc > 0)

along which the deformed AT model flows from the ultraviolet c = 1 fixed point
to the infrared c = 1/2 Ising fixed point.
We shall elaborate on the DM argument by explicitly constructing the mappings between the DSG model and various spin models, with the aim to fully
describe the Ising transition and, in particular, calculate correlation functions of
the operators in the original DSG model. The novel points of our analysis are as
follows. First, we concentrate on quantum lattice spin chain models rather than
on their classical counterparts (in the transfer matrix sense), as this formulation
profits from the use of the powerful apparatus of various spin operator transformations like the duality transformation. Secondly, we identify the correct degrees
of freedom in the deformed quantum AT model that become critical. Since the
original Ising models enter symmetrically, this is a nontrivial step which is accomplished via a ‘change of basis’ transformation. Let us denote the critical degrees
of freedom by σ and the remaining gaped degrees of freedom by τ (see the main
text for precise definitions). The strategy to calculate the correlation functions
is then to express the DSG-operators in terms of the lattice σ and τ operators.
At the Ising transition σ and τ operators asymptotically decouple, with the σoperators being critical and (some of) the τ operators acquiring finite average
values. This allows us to trace the relation between the original DSG-operators
and those from the operator content of the underlying critical Ising model, which
ultimately accomplishes a complete description of the critical properties at the
Ising transition.

3.1

Quantum Ising spin chain

We start with recollecting some basic facts about the quantum Ising (QI) spin
chain. The Hamiltonian of the QI chain describes a 1D Ising model in a transverse
magnetic field [6]:
HQI [σ] = −

(4)

where σnα are the Pauli matrices associated with the lattice sites {n}. The Hamil-

tonian HQI defines the transfer matrix of the classical 2D Ising model [7].

An important tool in studying 1D spin lattice models is the Kramers-Wannier
duality transformation that we shall make extensive use of in the sequel. Consider
a dual lattice consisting of sites {n + 1/2}, defined as the centres of the links

< n, n + 1 > of the original lattice, and assign spin operators µn+1/2 to the dual
lattice sites. The duality transformation then relates the dual spins to the original
ones as follows
µzn+1/2 =

the inverse transformation being

(6)

j=0

In Hamiltonian (4), the parameters J and ∆ are interchanged under the duality
transformation, so that J = ∆ is the self-duality point where the model displays
an Ising criticality.
The operators σnz and µzm+1/2 , conventionally referred to as order and disorder operators, are mutually nonlocal and play the role of ‘string operators’ with
respect to each other. In particular, they commute for m < n but anticommute
otherwise. These commutation properties make the duality construction a convenient starting point for introducing lattice fermions. It is immediate to check
that two objects
ηn = σnz µzn−1/2 = µzn−1/2 σnz ,

(7)

ζn = iσnz µzn+1/2 = −iµzn+1/2 σnz ,

(8)

satisfy the anticommutation relations for the real (Majorana) fermions on the
lattice, with the normalisation ηn2 = ζn2 = 1. Relations (7) and (8) are nothing but

the inverse of the Jordan–Wigner transformation, with the ‘direct’ transformation
being of the form

The next step is to take a continuum limit. To this end one introduces a lattice
spacing a0 , treats x = na0 as a continuum variable, and replaces ηn and ζn by
slowly varying Majorana fields, η(x) and ζ(x):
ηn →

then is

Bosonization of the deformed quantum Ashkin–Teller

The standard quantum Ashkin-Teller (QAT) model is defined as a model of two
identical QI spin chains, described by Hamiltonians HQI [σ1 ] and HQI [σ2 ] [see

Eq.(4)], which are coupled via a self-dual inter-chain interaction:

We wish to establish a relationship between the deformed quantum Ashkin–
Teller (DQAT) model (17) and the DSG model. These two models can be mapped
onto each other using the Zuber-Itsykson trick[8]. The idea is to associate the
two QI chains with two copies of Majorana fermions,

combine ξ 1 and ξ 2 into a single Dirac field and then bosonize the latter using the
standard rules of Abelian bosonization.
First we notice that, in the case of two QI spin chains, the Jordan–Wigner
transformation (7)–(9) should be slightly modified. This follows from the requirement that the spin operators belonging to different chains should commute. While
this is automatically true for the disorder operators µαa,n+1/2 (α = x, y, z; a = 1, 2)
because of their bosonic character, to ensure commutation between the order paz

one has to introduce two anticommuting (Klein) factors

With the spin variables σ1,2 and µ1,2 subject to the duality relations (5), (6),

ζa,n .

and admits a straightforward passage to the continuum limit. The corresponding

which is obviously equivalent to the massive Thirring model for a single Dirac
fermion. Using the standard rules of Abelian bosonization which are briefly summarised in Appendix A.1, one maps the QAT model onto a β 2 = 4π quantum SG
model with a marginal perturbation [4]:
√
HQAT ⇒ H0 [Φ] − 8Ka0 ∂x φR ∂x φL − (m/a0 ) cos 4πΦ.

(22)

Notice that, the bosonization of the QAT model can be also achieved by first
mapping the model onto a single chain of spinless fermions, and then bosonizing
the latter. This alternative route is traced in Appendix B.
Turning to the DQAT model, we observe that the h-term in (17) is nonlocal in
terms of lattice Majorana operators. However, it is known that, for two identical
Ising models close to criticality, products of two Ising operators belonging to
different chains, σ1 σ2 , µ1 µ2 , σ1 µ2 , µ1 σ2 , all with scaling dimension 1/4, can
be expressed locally in terms of bosonic vertex operators with the same scaling
dimension (see, for instance, [9] and references therein). In Appendix A.2, we
rederive this correspondence starting from the lattice theory of two quantum
Ising chains and paying special attention to the Klein factors:

(23)
(24)

Here Θ = −φR + φL is a scalar field dual to Φ.

Thus, Eq. (24) establishes the continuum bosonized version of the “magnetic

Notice that algebra (18) of the Klein factors allows one to identify them with

having the structure of the DSG model (3) and differing only in the sign of the
coupling constant h. The identification of the parameters is as follows: γ = 8Ka0 ,
g = m/a0 , and λ = h/a0 (it is understood that when a0 → 0, K → ∞, m, h → 0

so as to keep the DSG parameters finite).

The 2×2 matrix form of Ĥ reflects the symmetry of the DQAT model with

respect to the interchange of the two constituent quantum chains, (P12 ), under
which the DSG Hamiltonians H± transform to each other. Formally, this sym-

metry appears as “unphysical” because the Hamiltonian Ĥ commutes with τ3 .
This allows one to set

κ1 κ2 = i,

(30)

and study the Ising transition by projecting the matrix DQAT model onto the
subspace of a single DSG Hamiltonian H+ (the choice κ1 κ2 = −i, H → H−

would be as good as the above one). However, while κ1 κ2 is a conserved quantity,
each κi is not, implying that correlations functions of operators which contain the
Klein factors may involve transitions between the two different sectors τ3 = ±1.

We shall see below that some physical models are automatically mapped onto

a single DSG model with a fixed sign of h (section 5), while some others reduce
to the matrix form (28) (section 6). In the latter case, the effective P12 symmetry

corresponds to a physical discrete Z2 symmetry of the model in question, which

is spontaneously broken in the ground state, a typical example of this kind being
a spontaneously dimerized phase. In such situations, the Hamiltonians H± , when

considered separately, describe only excitations above each of the two degenerate
vacua. On the other hand, the two-fold degeneracy of the ground state necessarily
implies the existence of topological kinks which interpolate between neighbouring
10

degenerate minima of two different potentials U± , corresponding to H± . However,

in the entire parameter space of the model (28), including the Ising transition
point, the sets of minima of the potentials U± always have a finite relative shift.

This means that the topological Z2 kinks always remain massive and thus appear

as irrelevant excitations as long as Ising criticality is concerned.
Thus, when working with a single Hamiltonian H+ , all operators representing

strongly fluctuating fields at the Ising critical point are automatically taken into
account. All “off-diagonal” operators proportional to κ1 or κ2 , such as those
given by (25) and (26), can be dropped as they represent short-ranged fields at
the critical point.

Deformed quantum Ashkin-Teller model in the
(σ, τ ) representation and the Ising transition

The original two-chain representation of the Hamiltonian (17) is not the most
appropriate one to describe the role of the coupling term (27), but some general
statements can already be drawn at this stage. First of all it is clear that, if
the chains are originally in the ordered phase, the role of the h-term would be
exhausted by removing the degeneracy between the four ground states specified
z
z
i. The lowest-energy
i and σ2 = hσ2n
by the signs of the order parameters σ1 = hσ1n

sector, determined by the condition hσ1 σ2 > 0, will stay massive anyway. (For two
ordered Ising copies, the h-term gives rise to an effective longitudinal magnetic
field applied to both Ising systems and thus keeping them massive.) Therefore,
new effects can be only expected if the two chains are originally disordered.
We can give an heuristic argument in favour of an Ising critical point that
appears at a finite h, if at h = 0 the chains are disordered. For the sake of clarity,
let us make a duality transformation and replace the original model by a pair of
two ordered Ising copies well below Tc , coupled by the interaction hµ1 µ2 . Consider
a single quantum Ising model (4) at J ≫ ∆. In the leading approximation, its
ground state is fully polarised. The disorder operator µzn+1/2 creates a domain
wall by flipping all the spins within the interval 1 ≤ j ≤ n. At short distances,

the domain walls behave like hard-core bosons which, in the dilute limit, are
equivalent to spinless fermions with the dispersion
ǫ(k) = 2J − 2∆ cos ka0 .
11

The coupling term hµ1 µ2 creates or destroys a pair of domains walls, one for each
chain. Therefore, in the dilute limit, the effective Hamiltonian for the fermions
describing domain walls is of the form:
H=

(31)

where heff ∝ ∆h/J. The combinations of the creation and annihilation operah

tors that appear in the coupling term reflect the fact that µzn+1/2

i2

= 1. It is

clear that the model (31) is a theory of four Majorana fermions, two of which
are not affected by the coupling term. The remaining part of Hamiltonian can
be straightforwardly diagonalized and reduced to two Majorana fields with the
masses

∆h
.
J
The Ising criticality is reached when one of the masses vanishes, which occurs
m± = 2J ± const.

when h ∼ J 2 /∆. In the dual representation, the above estimation of the critical

field should be replaced by h ∼ ∆2 /J. Strictly speaking, the domain walls do not
posses a fermionic statistics but contain a Jordan-Wigner type phase, which can
only be neglected in the extreme dilute limit.
Although the above argument provides a qualitative explanation of the transition, a satisfying description of the critical region can only be reached if we
are able to properly identify the degrees of freedom which get critical and those
which do not (and, of course, take into account the correct stastistics of the
domain walls). For this purpose, let us introduce a new Ising variable
z
z
τnz = σ1,n

(32)

Namely, let us switch from the original two-chain representation, with basic spin

operators σ1n
and σ2n
, to a new one where the basic variables are τnz and σnz = σ1n
z
(due to the P12 symmetry of the model, the choice τnz and σnz = σ2n
would be

equivalent). In the original (σ1 -σ2 ) representation, the local (i.e. at a fixed lattice
site n) Hilbert space of the two-chain model is spanned by the basis vectors |σ1 , σ2 i
which are eigenstates of σ1z and σ2z :

z
σ1,2
|σ1 , σ2 i = σ1,2 |σ1 , σ2 i,

where σ = σ1 , τ = σ1 σ2 . Comparing matrix elements of the operators σ1n

We also need to define the variables µn and νn dual to σn and τn , respectively.
The pairs (σn , µn ) and (τn , νn ) should obey the duality relations (5) and (6). Using
these relations together with (33), one finds out how the dual spins transform
under the change of basis:
z
µz1,n+1/2 = µzn+1/2 νn+1/2

µz2,n+1/2 = νn+1/2

(34)

In the σ-τ representation the DQAT model (17) transforms to another twochain model which we call the σ-τ model:
H[σ, τ ] = Hσ + Hτ + Hστ .

(35)

Here Hσ is a QI Hamiltonian similar to (4) but with different parameters:

A mean-field approach to (35) is outlined in Appendix C, here we shall concentrate on the large-h limit. For large h, the τ -degrees of freedom freeze in a
configuration where hτnz i ≃ 1, and hτnx i ≃ ∆/h. The σ-degrees of freedom are

13

we are lead to conclude that, both at strong and weak h, the Ising transition
essentially corresponds the situation when the σ degrees of freedom go massless,
while the τ degrees of freedom remain frozen in a disordered configuration with
both hτ z i and hτ x i nonzero. Notice that, with the above strong-coupling descrip-

tion, we are unable to determine the critical line and even estimate the strength of
the irrelevant operators close to this line. This means that, even though the uni-

versal properties of the DSG model at the Ising transition, including the singular
parts of physical quantities and critical exponents of the correlation functions, will
be captured correctly, the nonuniversal parts, such as prefactors and subleading
corrections to main asymptotics, are not to be trusted.
Let us conclude this section by noticing two important facts which will prove
useful in the next Section devoted to the correlation functions.
(i) Quantum critical points are associated with gapless phases which are realized under certain conditions imposed on the parameters of the model. As
soon as any of those parameters is shifted away from the criticality constraint, the system becomes off-critical. The corresponding perturbations
to the critical Hamiltonian are therefore relevant operators with conformal dimensions determined by the universality class of the critical model.
Notice that there is no magnetic field coupled to σ z in the exact lattice
Hamiltonian (35). Therefore a departure from criticality by changing any
one of the couplings (h, J, ∆J , or K) will give rise to an Ising mass term.
(ii) From Eq.(39), if we reasonably take |K| < 2J, we arrive at the conclusion

that, for h > hc , the σ degrees of freedom are ordered, while they are

disordered otherwise.

Correlation functions

In this Section we use the results of the above quantum-spin-chain type mappings
to determine the physical properties of the DSG model close to the criticality.

5.1

DSG operators in the (σ, τ ) representation: UV-IR
transmutation

In preceding sections we have shown that (i) the DQAT model can be mapped
onto the DSG model which is a Gaussian free theory of the field Φ(x) in the
14

ultraviolet (UV) limit, and that (ii) the DQAT can also be mapped onto the
(σ, τ ) model which, at the Ising transition, essentially reduces to a single critical
Ising model of the order field σ(x) and disorder field µ(x) in the infrared (IR)
limit. Our aim here is to find out how the operators of the DSG model, originally
defined in the vicinity of the UV fixed point, “transmute” when going from the
UV limit to the IR limit.
5.1.1

Current operators

We start with holomorphic, or current, operators that are made up of additive
(analytic and anti-analytic) chiral parts. Of physical interest are the vector and
axial current densities which, in terms of the bosonic field of the DSG model, are
defined as
1
J(x) = JR (x) + JL (x) = √ ∂x Φ(x),
π
1
1
J5 (x) = JR (x) − JL (x) = − √ ∂x Θ(x) = − √ ∂t Φ(x).
π
π

(40)
(41)

In physical situations, J(x) determines the smooth part of the charge or spin
density [J(x) ≡ ρ(x)], while J5 (x) describes the corresponding charge or spin

current [J5 (x) ≡ j(x)]. As follows from (114), (115), these can be expressed in
terms of the Majorana fields ξ 1 and ξ 2 :

J(x) = i [ξ1R (x)ξ2R (x) + ξ1L (x)ξ2L (x)] ,

(42)

J5 (x) = i [ξ1R (x)ξ2R (x) − ξ1L (x)ξ2L (x)] .

(43)

Making the inverse chiral rotation from (ξRa , ξLa ) to (η a , ζ a ), (a = 1, 2), we can
define a local lattice operator
Jn =

i
(η1n η2n + ζ1n ζ2n ) ,
2

(44)

which reproduces (42) in the continuum limit. Using the inverse Jordan-Wigner
relations (19) and transformations (33),(34), we obtain:

(45)

(here we have implemented our Klein factor convention (30)). Using the fact
that the τ -field is noncritical and has a nonzero expectation value, we pass to
15

the continuum limit and thus find the expression for the current density at the
infrared fixed point:
J(x) → C∂x µ(x),

(46)

where C ∼ hτ z i is a nonuniversal number, and µ(x) is the Ising disorder field at
the criticality. Thus, the UV-IR transmutation of the current density is given by



J(x) = 

√1 ∂x Φ(x)
π

UV,

C∂x µ(x)

IR.

(47)

Turning to the axial current J5 , we notice that the latter is related to the
vector current J via the continuity equation:
∂t J(x, t) + ∂x J5 (x, t) = 0.

(48)

As a result, the IR form of J5 (x) can be immediately recovered. Indeed, the
Ising disorder field µ is a scalar field (with zero conformal spin). This means that
holomorphic properties of the vector and axial current operators are lost at the
IR fixed point. Then the result (46), together with the requirements of Lorentz
invariance and continuity equation (48), leads to the correspondence
J5 (x) =





− √1π ∂t Φ(x) UV,

−C∂t µ(x)

IR,

(49)

with the same prefactor C as in Eq.(47), provided that the velocity is set v = 1.
As an important consistency check, we still need to explicitly determine the
lattice version of the current operator. One might naïvely conclude that, since
under the inverse chiral rotation (12) the axial current density transforms to
J5 (x) = −i [ζ1 (x)η2 (x) + η1 (x)ζ2 (x)] ,

(50)

it would be sufficient to replace the r.h.s. of (50) by its local (single-site) counterpart which one might identify with Jn5 . This route is misleading because, in
the lattice formulation, the particle current is always defined on a link (n, n + 1)
and, therefore, should be determined from the equation of motion
i∂t Jn = [Jn , HDQAT ] .

(51)

which, in the continuum limit, is supposed to reduce to Eq.(48). It can easily
be checked that the (density) operator, Jn , commutes with all the interaction
terms in the lattice DQAT Hamiltonian (17), since all of them, including the hterm, are made up of the density operators. Therefore the above commutator is
16

only contributed to by the Majorana kinetic energy term in (17) and so is easily
computed:
i∂t Jn = Qn,n+1 − Qn−1,n ,

(52)

where

J
Qn,n+1 = − (η1,n+1 ζ2n + ζ1n η2,n+1 ) .
4
In terms of the lattice spins this reads
J
5
z
Jn,n+1
= − (τnz + τn+1

2

(53)

(54)

In the IR continuum limit this becomes ∼ ∂t µ since ∂t µ ∼ i[µz , HQI ] ∼ µy , as
immediately follows from the dual version of the QI spin chain Hamiltonian. Thus
we arrive at the IR representation of the axial current given by (49).
5.1.2

Vertex operators

The analysis of the vertex operators
Vβ [Φ] = eiβΦ
is in fact simpler than that of the holomorphic operators. There are two cases of
√
√
physical interest: β = ± π and β = ± 4π.
From (24), (30) and (32) it follows that
sin

√

πΦ ∼ σ1 σ2 ∼ τ ∼ I,

(55)

(I being the identity operator), as the τ model is always off-critical. This is a
reasonable result since the above operator is directly present in the DSG Hamiltonian (3). However, as we mentioned in the previous Section, the operator
√
sin πΦ corresponds to the departure from the criticality of the σ-model. So,
this operator, though having a finite average value, should also possess an extra
term which, at the critical point, represents a strongly fluctuating field (with a
power-law decaying correlation function). A more correct version of the formula
(55) is therefore as follows:
sin

√

πΦ ∼ I + ε,

(56)

where ε is the energy density (or a Majorana mass bilinear) operator. This
follows from the first observation (i) at the end of Section 4, which states that
moving h from its critical value results in the stress-energy tensor renormalisation

and, more importantly, in the appearance of the Majorana mass, i.e. the Ising

Finally, the behaviour of β = ± 4π operators is determined in full analogy

to the above discussion:

V±√4π [Φ] ∼ I + ǫ.

Our results on UV-IR DSG operators transmutations are summarised in table
I.

5.2

Correlation functions

Having identified the operators at the IR fixed point, we can now determine
leading asymptotics of the correlation functions. Most of the operators of physical
interest can be expressed in terms of the Ising disorder operator µ at the Ising
transition point and in its close vicinity.
For physical applications of the DSG model, it is important to investigate the
dynamical susceptibility defined as the frequency-momentum Fourier transform
of the retarded auto-correlation function of the Ising disorder parameter: function

It is known that, at criticality, D(r) = 1/r 1/4 where r = (τ, x) (τ = it, and v
is set to 1). Furthermore, away from criticality, in the ordered phase, D(r) =

18

(A1 /π)K0 (mr) where A1 is related to the Glaisher constant. The crossover between these two regimes, r ≪ ξ = 1/m and r > ξ, respectively, is complicated and
is described in terms of the Painlevé theory [10]. If, following [10], we introduce,
ζ=r

d ln D
,
dr

then the function ζ can be shown to satisfy
(rζ ′′)2 = 4(rζ ′ − ζ 2 )(rζ ′ − ζ) + (ζ ′ )2 ,
which is related to Painlevé V equation and can, in turn, be shown to produce the
correct conformal and massive limits. As the exact expressions are uncomfortable
for calculations, we shall estimate the Fourier transforms from the asymptotes of
the correlation function D(r). Therefore, first we summarise known results on
the limiting behaviour of this function.
At criticality
D0 (r) =

(68)

Therefore, as long as ω 2 < p2 + 4m2 , the argument of the log-function in
(185) is real and positive, so the correlation function remains real without
dissipation. Above the two-particle threshold (ω 2 > p2 + 4m2 ), the correlation function has a branch cut and the dissipative part will appear as
follows:

Dimerized Heisenberg chain in a staggered
magnetic field

The DSG model exhibiting a nontrivial flow towards Ising criticality can be realized as an effective continuum theory for a number of quantum 1D models
of strongly correlated electrons, in particular quantum spin chains and ladders.
In the context of spin systems, an effective DSG model can emerge within the

20

Abelian bosonization scheme when staggered fields breaking translational invariance, such as an explicit dimerization (bond alternation)[3] or a staggered magnetic field, are added to an originally translationally invariant model with a gaped
ground state1 .
Perhaps the simplest example of this kind is given by the spin-1/2 Heisenberg
chain with nearest-neighbour (J1 ) and next-nearest-neighbour (J2 ) antiferromagnetic exchange interactions
HJ1 −J2 =

X
n

(J1 Sn · Sn+1 + J2 Sn · Sn+2 )

(70)

This model has been extensively studied during past years. If frustrating
interaction J2 is small enough, the model maintains the critical properties of the
unfrustrated Heisenberg chain (J2 = 0). At J2 ≥ J2c ≃ 0.24J1, frustration gets
relevant and drives the model to a massive phase characterised by spontaneously

broken parity[13, 14]. The ground state is dimerized and doubly degenerate,
and there exist massive elementary excitations - topological Z2 kinks carrying
the spin 1/2. At a special (Majumdar–Ghosh) point, J2 = 0.5J1 , the picture
is particularly simple because the two Z2 -degenerate ground states are given by
matrix products of singlet dimers formed either on the lattice links < 2n, 2n+1 >
or < 2n − 1, 2n >.

Under assumption that J1 ≫ J2 , the continuum limit of the J1 − J2 model

can be considered, and the resulting quantum field theory is that of a critical

SU(2)1 Wess–Zumino–Novikov–Witten (WZNW) model perturbed a marginal
current-current interaction[14]:

However, at γ > 0 the effective interaction flows to strong coupling, and the

While alternation of the nearest-neighbour exchange constants can originate from the spin-

phonon coupling, the case of a nonuniform magnetic field with a period 2a0 (a0 being the
lattice constant) used to be regarded as unrealistic, not achievable in experimental conditions.
Fortunately, the status of the staggered magnetic field has recently changed from exotic to
legitimate. It has been shown that, in some quasi-1D antiferromagnetic compounds, such
field can be realized as an intrinsic one. An effective staggered field can originate from the
Neel ordering of one magnetic sublattice and being experienced by loosely connected magnetic
chains which form another sublattice and remain disordered down to very low temperatures
[11]. A sign-alternating component of the magnetic field can be also effectively generated due
to a staggered anisotropy of the gyromagnetic tensor, as it is the case for the Copper-Benzoate
organic molecule [12].

21

system ends up in a spontaneously dimerized phase with a dynamically generated
spectral gap[14]: mdim ∼ Λ exp(−2π/γ), where Λ ∼ J1 is the UV cutoff.

Using Abelian bosonization, we can rewrite (71) as a sine-Gordon (SG) model:

(72)

The “hidden” SU(2) symmetry of this bosonic Hamiltonian is encoded in the
robust structure of the last two terms in Eq.(72), parametrised by a single coupling constant γ. This fact enforces the SG model (72) to occur either on the
weak-coupling SU(2) separatrix of the Kosterliz-Thouless phase diagram (γ < 0),
or on the strong-coupling SU(2) separatrix (γ > 0). In the latter case, quantum
solitons with the mass mdim and topological charge Q = 1 are identified with the
Z2 dimerization kinks carrying the spin S = Q/2 = 1/2. In the remainder of this
section we will be dealing with the massive, spontaneously dimerized phase.

constitute the staggered magnetisation and dimerization field of the S=1/2 Heisenberg chain. Representing
H ′ = λǫs + hs · ns ,

(76)

let us consider the two terms in (76) separately.
The role of weak explicit (spin-Peierls) dimerization in the spontaneously
dimerized J1 −J2 spin-1/2 chain has already been addressed by Affleck [3]. The ef-

fective double-frequency-sine-Gordon potential appearing in this case is different
from the one studied in this paper (c.f. Eq.(1)):

The λ-term in (77) removes the degeneracy between the neighbouring minima of

the unperturbed potential − cos 8πΦ (i.e. between the two degenerate dimerized
22

ground states) and thus leads to confinement of the solitons. The main physical
effect is the spinon-magnon transmutation: deconfined spinons of the frustrated
Heisenberg chain, carrying the spin S = 1/2, form bound states with S = 0 and
S = 1, the latter representing coherent triplet magnon excitations.
Let us concentrate on the case of the staggered magnetic field, hs :

in which we recognise the DSG model with the structure (1). From the analysis
of the preceding section we conclude that the spontaneously dimerized chain in
a staggered magnetic field has two phases separated by a quantum critical point
at hs = h∗s . At hs < h∗s a “mixed” phase is realized, with coexisting dimerization
hǫs i =
6 0 and staggered magnetization hns i =
6 0. Notice that, as opposed to the

case of uniform magnetic field that couples to the (conserved) total magnetisation,

the dependence ns = ns (hs ) shows no threshold in hs . Dimerization vanishes at
the Ising critical point hs = h∗s and remains zero in the “pure Neel” phase,
hs > h∗s . The critical field h∗s can be estimated by comparing the dimerization
gap mdim with the gap that would open up at γ ≤ 0: mh ∼ h2/3
s . So the critical
staggered field is exponentially small: h∗s ∼ (mdim )3/2 .

Since the spin SU(2) symmetry is broken by the (staggered) magnetic field,

the total spin is not conserved, but the spin projection S z is. The latter circumstance allows one to identify the spin S z of elementary excitations as the
topological quantum number of the kinks interpolating between the nearest degenerate minima of the potential U(Φ) in (79). According to the structure of

U(Φ), there will be “short” and “long” kinks, carrying the spin S±z =

1
2

∓ δ,

where δ = δ(hs ) smoothly increases from δ = 0 at hs = 0 to δ = 1/2 at hs ≥ h∗s .
Therefore, in the mixed phase, the original massive S = 1/2 spinon splits into two

topological excitations carrying fractional spins S±z . These spins become S z = 1

and S z = 0 at the Ising transition, and it is just the singlet kink which loses

its topological charge and becomes massless at hs = h∗s . The existence of the
fractional-spin excitations in the mixed phase (hs < h∗s ) is nothing but the spin
version of the charge fractionization of topological excitations found earlier in 1D

We have the following correspondence:

on approaching the critical point. The staggered magnetisation, on the other
hand, is always finite in both phases. Its behaviour at the transition is determined

(the function D (R) has been extensively discussed in Section (5)), the staggered
susceptibility is in turn related to the correlation function of the Ising energydensity operator. The latter object is a Majorana bilinear
ε(x) ∼ ξR (x)ξL (x).
Therefore, calculating the staggered magnetic susceptibility reduces to a simple task of computing the polarisation loop diagram for free, massive Majorana
fermions. The result is

We notice that for h > hs it obviously is the staggered field operator (β 2 = 2π)
which alone dictates the physics of our effective DSG model (not only is it the most
relevant operator, but it also has a large amplitude). It is therefore instructive
to compare the results for the dynamical magnetic susceptibility of the DSG
model we have found via Ising-type mappings with those for the SG model with
a β 2 = 2π operator only, which were obtained in the paper [17] by means of the
form-factor technique. As for h > hs we enter the ordered phase (hµi=0), the
uniform susceptibility (86,67) is of a coherent nature, very much in agreement
with [17] (‘magnon’ contribution). The staggered susceptibility (87,88), on the
other hand, is incoherent in excellent agreement with the kink-antikink continuum
observed in [17] (the breather contribution is missed in our approach; it might
be recovered as a bound state of Majorana fermions, but we shall not push our
analysis beyond this point). No analogous comparison can be made for h < hs
(no form-factor calculations are, to our knowledge, currently available for the
β 2 = 8π SG model, and, even if they were, a comparison would have been of
dubious validity, as the addition of the β 2 = 2π-operator qualitatively changes
the spectrum from the start).

Ising transition in the 1D Hubbard model with
alternating chemical potential

The DSG model finds a number of interesting applications in the theory of 1D
strongly correlated electron systems. In this section we shall consider a particular example of this kind which has been recently discussed in Ref.[16] – a 1D
repulsive Hubbard model at 1/2-filling with a sign-alternating single-site energy
(i.e. staggered chemical potential). The Hamiltonian of this model reads:
H = −t

(89)

i,σ

where ciσ is the annihilation operator of an electron with the spin projection σ,
residing at the lattice site i, and niσ = c†iσ ciσ . The model (89) was originally
proposed in the context of quasi-1D organic materials [18] and is also believed to
be prototypical for ferroelectric perovskites [19].
In spite of its apparent simplicity, the model (89) reveals nontrivial physics. At
U = 0 it describes a band insulator (BI) with a spectral gap for all excitations. At
∆ ≪ t, the low-energy spectrum of the BI is that of free massive Dirac fermions.
26

When the Hubbard interaction is switched on, the finite fermionic mass ∆ makes
the theory free of infrared divergences, so that the BI phase remains stable for
small enough U. On the other hand, at ∆ = 0, the Hamiltonian (89) coincides
with the standard (translationally invariant) Hubbard model which is exactly
solvable [20] and is well known to describe a Mott insulator (MI) at any positive
value of U, if the electron concentration n = (1/N)

P

i,σ

niσ = 1 (the case of a

1/2-filled energy band). The MI state has a finite mass gap mc in the charge
sector induced by commensurability of the electron density with the underlying
lattice. At energies well below mc , local charge fluctuations are suppressed, and
the low-energy spin dynamics of the model coincides with that of the spin-1/2
Heisenberg antiferromagnetic chain, the latter possessing a gapless spectrum. At
a finite U, the charge-gaped MI phase is stable against site alternation, provided
that ∆ is small enough [18].
Thus, the issue of interest is the nature of the crossover between the BI and MI
regimes which is expected to occur in the strong-coupling region where the singleparticle mass gap ∆ becomes comparable with the MI charge gap mc . Starting
out from the MI phase and decreasing U at a fixed ∆, one has to identify the
mechanism for the mass generation in the spin sector. On the other hand, it is
clear that the charge degrees of freedom should also be involved in the BI-MI
crossover. Indeed, dividing the lattice into two sublattices, A and B, with the
single-site electron energies ∆ and −∆, respectively, and considering electronic

states of a diatomic (AB) unit cell in the limit t ≪ U, ∆, one finds a region U ∼ 2∆

where two charge configurations, A1 B 1 and A0 B 2 , become almost degenerate.
This is the so-called mixed-valence regime where those excitations responsible

for the charge redistribution among the two unit-cell configurations become soft.
This means that, apart from the spin transition, a charge transition associated
with vanishing of the charge gap at some value of U is also expected to occur.
In Ref.[16] we have shown that the MI-to-BI crossover, taking place on decreasing U at a fixed ∆, is realized as a sequence of two continuous transitions:
a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition at U = Uc2 where a spin gap
is dynamically generated, and an Ising critical point at U = Uc1 < Uc2 where
the charge gap vanishes. Assuming that U, ∆ ≪ t, below we shall consider the

effective low-energy field theory for the lattice model (89). We shall then briefly

comment on the spin transition and mostly concentrate on the Ising transition in
the charge sector of the model which will be described in terms of a DSG model.
The standard bosonization procedure (see e.g. [9]) allows one to represent the
27

Hamiltonian density as
Heff = Hc + Hs + Hcs .
Here the spin sector is described by the SU(2)1 WZNW model with a marginally
irrelevant current-current perturbation originating from the electron backscattering processes (g ∼ Ua0 > 0):
Hs =

(90)

where JR,L are chiral components of the vector spin current satisfying the SU1 (2)
Kac-Moody algebra. This Hamiltonian accounts for the universal properties of
the spin-1/2 antiferromagnetic Heisenberg chain in the scaling limit [21]. The
charge degrees of freedom are represented by a sine-Gordon model for a scalar
field Φc :

cesses (see e.g.[9]). For a wide class of Hamiltonians with finite-range interactions
(of which the Hubbard model is a member) the parameter Kc < 1. This means

that the model (91) is in a strong-coupling regime, and the dynamically generated
mass determines the gap mc in the charge sector. The charge and spin sectors
are coupled by the ∆-term:
Hcs = −

(92)

where ǫs is the spin dimerization field of the S=1/2 Heisenberg chain, defined in
(75).
Let us assume that we are in the MI regime with a gaped charge sector. Since
the charge field Φc is locked in one of degenerate minima of the periodic potential
in (91),
(Φc )m =

s

π

2Kc

m ∈ Z∞

it follows immediately that, in the MI phase, the operator sin

√

2πKc Φc appearing

in (92) does not represent a strongly fluctuating field; it is rather short-ranged
at distances ξc ∼ vc /mc , and this explains the stability of the MI phase against a

small ∆-perturbation. Assuming that the charge gap is nonzero, we integrate out
the massive charge degrees of freedom to obtain the effective action in the spin
sector. According to the unbroken SU(2) symmetry of the model, the effective
Hamiltonian in the spin sector retains its form (90), but the current-current
28

coupling constant undergoes an additive renormalization. In the second order in
∆ we obtain:
g → geff = g − C (∆/mc )2 vc
where C ∼ 1 is a nonuniversal numerical constant. The spin sector now resembles

the J1 − J2 frustrated spin-1/2 chain (see section 5) with an effecive next-nearest-

neighbour interaction J2 generated by the staggered chemical potential ∆. As
long as geff > 0, the spin excitation spectrum remains gapless. However, decreasing U at a fixed ∆ (or increasing ∆ at a fixed U) eventually reverts the above
inequality to geff < 0. In this case the current-current perturbation becomes
marginally relevant, and a continuous (BKT) transition takes place to a spontaneously dimerized insulating (SDI) phase with broken (site) parity and a finite
mass gap in the spin sector.
Thus, the condition geff = 0 determines the spin transition point Uc2 . Using
the exact result for the charge gap in the small-U Hubbard model[20],

mc ∼ Ute−2πt/U ,

we find that

(95)

It is instructive to compare the parity properties of the SDI and BI phases.
For models defined on a 1D lattice, there are two parity transformations – the site
parity (PS ) and link parity (PL ) [22]. The difference between PS and PL survives
the continuum limit and shows up in two inequivalent parity transformations that
keep the massless Dirac equation
(∂t + σ3 ∂x ) ψ(x) = 0,
invariant. These are





R 
ψ=
L

PS :

ψ(x) → σ1 ψ(−x)

(96)

PL :

ψ(x) → σ2 ψ(−x)

(97)

29

Using bosonization rules for spin-1/2 Dirac fermions (see e.g. [9]), one easily finds
that both PS and PL lead to
Φc (x) → −Φc (−x),
whereas the WZNW field ĝs transforms differently:
PS :

ĝs (x) → −ĝs (−x)

(98)

PL :

ĝs (x) → ĝs (−x)

(99)

Comparing (92) and (95), we see that the ∆-perturbation breaks PL but is invariant under PS (in fact, PS is the symmetry of the Hamiltonian (89)), while the
dimerization operator D breaks PS but preserves PL . This is easily understood
by noticing that these two terms have the structure of two different fermionic
mass bilinears, ψ † σ1 ψ and ψ † σ2 ψ, with opposite transformation properties with
respect to PS and PL . Thus, the parity properties of the SDI and BI phases are
different, and this is a strong indication that the passage from SDI to BI should
be associated with a significant redistribution of the charge density (charge transition).
In what follows, we will not be dealing with estimation of the transition point
Uc1 . Referring the reader to Ref.[16] where the mechanism of the charge transition
is discussed in the context of excitonic instability of the BI phase, here we simply
claim that for the model (89), within the leading logarithmic accuracy, Uc2 /Uc1 −

1 = const/ ln (t/∆), where the positive constant is of the order of unity. Let us

instead focus on a nonperturbative description of the charge transition to the BI
phase. Suppose we are in the SDI phase with both charge and spin sectors gaped.

The robust ingredients of the potential (101) are the vertex operators and the
signs of the corresponding amplitudes. It can be shown that, as long as the
parameter Kc is confined within the interval 1/2 < Kc < 1, this potential, with all
terms being strongly relevant perturbations, is indeed the most representative one
for the model under discussion because no new relevant operators are generated
in the course of renormalization. This is no longer true if Kc < 1/2, the regime
which can be realized for an extended model with extra finite-range interactions,
e.g. V

P

i

ni ni+1 . In this case, new relevant vertex operators will be generated

upon renormalization, and the continuous Ising transition in the charge sector
can transform to a first-order one. We will comment on that in the end of this
section.
A simple analysis of the saddle points of the potential U(εc , εs )[16] shows that
q

the location of its minima in the spin sector, εs =

π/2n, and hence the spin

quantum numbers of the topological excitations, are the same as in the BI phase
(U < Uc1 ). So the spin part of the spectrum in the SDI phase smoothly transforms
to that of the BI phase. Therefore, being interested in the redistribution of the
√
charge degrees of freedom in the vicinity of Uc1 , in (101) we can replace cos 2πΦs
√
by its vacuum expectation value, hcos 2πΦs i = ±c0 . The two signs here reflect

the Z2 degeneracy of the dimerized ground state (spontaneously broken site parity; see Eq. (98)). Thus, the Hamiltonian of effective model describing the charge
degrees of freedom can be represented in the following 2×2 matrix form:
Hc;eff

We have arrived at the matrix version of DSG model similar to (28), (29).

To make contact with the DQAT model discussed in detail in sections 2 and 3,
we shall consider Hc;eff in the vicinity of the point Kc = 1/2. Setting Kc =

transforms Hc(±) in (103) to a form similar to H± of Eq.(29).

With this correspondence and all the results of the previous sections, we are

now able to describe in detail the Ising transition in the charge sector. As already
explained in section 2.2, this can be done by considering only the Hamiltonian
Hc(+) .
When studying the physical properties of our model (89) at the charge transition point, it is important to remember that the disordered (h < hc ) and ordered
(h > hc ) phases of the effective Ising model correspond to the SDI and BI phases
of the electronic model (89). First we consider the dimerization operator (95):
q
√
D ∼ cos 2πKc Φc cos 2πΦs .
√
With the spin field Φs locked in the SDI phase, hcos 2πΦs i = +c0 and Kc = 1/2,
this transforms to the charge polarisation field

√
D ∼ cos πΦc .
In full agreement with the physical picture, from (57) it follows that the operator
D, being the order parameter of the SDI phase, is the most strongly fluctuating

field at the Ising trasntion:

D∼µ

(104)

Its average value is nonzero in the SDI phase and vanishes as hDi ∼ (hc −h)1/8 on

approaching the charge transition point (remaining zero in the whole BI phase).

Using (55), we find that the average value of the ∆-perturbation, which, at
Kc = 1/2, is given by O∆ ∼ sin πΦc is nonsingular across the transition and

remains finite in both phases.

The most interesting feature of the Ising transition is the UV-IR transmutation
of the charge density ρc (x) and current Jc (x). At Kc = 1/2, the UV limit of our
model represents a metallic state with central charge cU V = 2, described in terms
of two massless Gaussian fields Φc and Φs . In this limit
1
ρc (x) = √ ∂x Φc (x),
π

1
Jc (x) = − √ ∂x Θc (x).
π

According to (47),(49), at the Ising criticality (cIR = 1/2),
ρc (x) = C∂x µ(x),

Jc (x) = −C∂t µ(x)
32

(105)

With µ(x) representing the charge polarization field, Eqs.(105) identify ρc and
Jc as the bound charge and polarisation-current densities, respectively. Such an
identification is typical for insulators rather than metals. This could have been
anticipated from the fact that a true metallic state with charge-carrying gapless
excitations cannot be described by a single massless real (Majorana) field.
An insulating (semi-metallic) behaviour of the model at the quantum critical
point, reached at the charge transition, becomes manifest when one estimates the
optical conductivity:
σ(ω) ∼ −ωℑmD (R) (ω, 0).

(106)

Here D (R) (ω, q) is the retarded correlation function defined in (60). Using the
result (66), we find that, at zero temperature, σ(ω) displays a universal power-law
behaviour:
σ0 (ω) ∼ ω −3/4

(107)

Although the optical conductivity is divergent in the zero-frequency limit, there
is no Drude-peak contribution (∼ δ(ω)) typical of true metals.
It is also possible to estimate the optical conductivity at finite temperatures
(keeping in mind the σ −τ representation of the DQAT model, one should assume

that T is much smaller than the mass gap in the decoupled τ degrees of freedom).
This can be done using conformal mapping from a cylinder [−∞ < x < ∞; 0 <

τ < β] onto a complex plane C. Starting with the T = 0 asymptotics of the
correlation function
hµ(z1 , z̄1 )µ(z2 , z̄2 )i ∝

First order transition at β 2 < 2π

Until now we assumed that 2π < β 2 < 8π, so that no other relevant operators were
generated upon renormalization. Indeed, already at β 2 < 32π/9, the operator
sin [(3β/2) Φ(x)], which is generated by the OPE of the two operators present in
(1), becomes relevant. However, such an operator does not modify the qualitative
behaviour of the model, as one can easily realize by a quasi-classical analysis. On
the contrary, the operator cos (2βΦ(x)), which is also generated by the OPE, and
which becomes relevant at β 2 < 2π, can modify the properties of the model in a
relevant manner. Indeed, inspecting the quasi-classical potential
!

2
one finds that the Ising transition is turned by a sufficiently large V into a first
order one.
The capability of an apparently subleading operator to change a continuous
transition to a first order one is indeed common to a variety of models. For
instance, it is known that the critical line with non universal exponents separating
the Charge Density Wave (CDW) and the Spin Density Wave (SDW) phases of the
extended (U-V) Hubbard model, becomes a first order line at sufficiently strong
coupling[24]. In fact, in the extended Hubbard model, the charge Luttinger liquid
exponent Kc can be lower than 1/2, the point at which the second harmonics of
the Umklapp scattering starts to be relevant. Therefore, at sufficiently strong
interaction, it can indeed turn the CDW–SDW transition line into a first order
one. A similar situation occurs with the charge transition in the electronic model,
considered in section 7, when the latter is generalised to include a sufficiently
strong nearest-neighbour repulsion [18].

Conclusions

In this paper, we have proposed a nonperturbative description of the Ising criticality in the DSG model (1). Using the equivalence between the DSG model and
a deformed quantum Ashkin-Teller model, valid in the vicinity of the decoupling
point, β 2 = 4π, we were able to identify the effective Ising degrees of freedom
that asymptotically decouple from the rest of the spectrum and become critical
in the infrared limit. This identification allowed us to describe the UV-IR “transmutation” of all physical fields of the DSG model and calculate the correlation
functions at and close to the transition. We have also demonstrated the efficiency
of our approach to describe Ising transitions in some physical realizations of the
DSG model.
We believe that our quantum-Ising-chain approach can be generalised to the
case when the number of the constituent Ising models, coupled by the interaction
h

Q

j

σj , is larger than 2. Such situation can indeed be realized in certain SU(2)-

invariant spin-ladders models which can be driven to criticality under the action
of external staggered fields. In such systems, the quantum critical points may
be not only of the Ising type but also correspond to SU(2)k WZNW universality
class. Such examples will be considered elsewhere [2].

fermions reads

On the other hand let us consider the simplest nearest-neighbour interaction for
spinless fermions, namely
V

X

c†2n c2n c†2n+1 c2n+1 + c†2n+1 c2n+1 c†2n+2 c2n+2 .

This interaction term turns out to be equivalent to (159), apart from a chemical
potential term, provided 4K = −V . Notice that, if one considers an Ashkin-Teller

this translates into a staggered interaction for the spinless fermion model. This
interaction, even without an explicit dimerization, is able to gap the fermionic
43

spectrum, thus showing the importance of self-duality, even at the level of the
coupling term (147), to get a critical behaviour.
Therefore we have shown the equivalence between a model of two coupled
Ising chains in a transverse field, given by the Hamiltonian (147), and a model of
spinless fermion with nearest neighbour interaction and dimerized hopping.
An interesting point in this respect regards quantum numbers. The spinless
fermion model has for instance conserved number of particle. In ρ is the density,
in the reduced chain we must have that
1X
ρRn + ρLn = 2ρ,
L n

(160)

is conserved. On the other hand
1X
(ρRn + ρLn − 1) = 2ρ − 1
L n

which, in terms of Ising variables, implies the conservation of a very non-local
operator, which includes the spins and their dual counterparts.

B.1

Operator identities

We can build up several operator identities in the lattice representation.
(1) The simplest one is obtained by the identity
2 (ρRn + ρLn − 1) = i (ζ1n ζ2n + ξ1n ξ2n ) ,

(161)

which relates the density operator of the spinless fermions to a particular
bilinear of Majorana’s fermions.
(2) The other identity derives from the equality




2 c†Rn cLn + H.c. = i (ξ1n ξ2n − ζ1n ζ2n ) ,

(162)

which relates the charge density wave operator of the spinless fermions to
the Majorana’s fermions.
(3) The last identity is obtained by the equality




− 2i c†Rn cLn − H.c. = i (ζ1n ξ1n + ζ2n ξ2n ) ,

(163)

which provides a relation between the dimerization operator and the Majorana’s fermions.

C

Mean-field treatment of the (σ, τ )-model

In oder to devise an appropriate mean-field scheme, let us formally rewrite Hamiltonian (35) as
H[σ, τ ] = Hmf [σ] + Hmf [τ ] + Hf luc [σ, τ ] + const.

(164)

Here the two terms of the mean-field Hamiltonian are:
Hmf [σ] = −
Hmf [τ ] = −

(168)

In the leading approximation, fluctuations described by (168) are neglected,
and the σ and τ degrees of freedom decouple. We notice that the parameter h
appears only in Hmf [τ ] where it plays the role of an effective longitudinal field.
Therefore the model (166) is a quantum counterpart of a 2D Ising model in a
nonzero external field which is known to be always noncritical. Thus, as expected,
the τ -chain is always gapped. The condition for the σ-chain to be critical then
reads:




z
J 1 + hτnz τn+1
i = ∆hτnx i − K

(169)

Despite the fact that the Ising model in the field is supposed to be integrable
in the continuum limit (see references in [10]), the explicit expectation values
of the τ operators appearing in (169) are not known. To make further analytic
progress possible, we choose a special value of the field rescaling parameter K,
z
K = Jhσnz σn+1
i,

(170)

at which Jτ = 0, and interaction between the neighbouring τ -spins in Hmf [τ ]
vanishes. This trivialises the τ -model and leads to

The requirement that the r.h.side of (175) is positive yields a restriction upon ∆:

J
π

(176)

Recall that we already assumed that at h = 0 the two QI chains of the QAT model
are disordered: ∆ > J. The restriction (176) tells us that, for the Ising criticality
to be reached at some critical value of h, the original disordered σ1 and σ2 chains
should be far enough from their original critical point. In fact, as follows from
(176), the value of the Majorana mass, when estimated as m ∼ 2(∆ − J) ∼ 4J/π,
turns out to be of the order of the ultraviolet cutoff. This estimation reflects the

already mentioned fact that the DM transition is indeed not a weak-coupling one
from the standpoint of the DQAT model.
One could, in principle, perturbatively calculate the fluctuation corrections,
i.e. those originating from (168), to the criticality condition. As the model is
only tractable under fine tuning (170) of the parameter K, that is not expected
to generalise the qualitative picture obtained in the mean-field approximation.

D

Correlation functions

Let us start calculating the Fourier transform of D (R) (ω, p), given by (60), with
the remark that using the Bessel functions (despite some convenient Fourier transforms) is beyond the accuracy. The analytic properties (and the issue of coherent
particle poles) should not depend on fine details of the correlators at r ∼ ξ = 1/m.

Therefore what one ought to do is to study analytic properties of the integral

(178)

In the area of convergence, we have [25]:
Iαm (q) =

Γ(α + 1/2)
F (α/2 + 1/4, α/2 + 3/4; 1; −q 2/m2 )
α+1/2
m

(179)

where F (a, b; c; z) stands for the hypergeometric function. The character of the
singularity at z = 1 can be determined by using appropriate transformation formulas for the hypergeometric functions and the Γ-function doubling formula[25]:
Iαm (q)|q2≃−m2 =

(2m)α−1/2 Γ(α)

√
2
π
(q + m2 )α

(180)

where only the leading, most divergent term is retained.

threshold, unless α = 1 which, of course, corresponds to the disordered case:
D> (q) =

Although this calculation is instructive, formula (180) doesn’t solve all our
problems. So, the critical correlation function has nothing to do with the m → 0

limit of this formula, as the main contribution to the integral comes from a
different spatial domain. Therefore we should rather return to the general formula
(179), set m = 0 there, and analytically continue beyond the convergence domain
(−1/2 < α < 1/2). The result is
D0 (q) = 21/4 π

Γ(7/8) 1
Γ(1/8) q 7/4

(182)

The correlation function in the disordered phase is also outside the validity
of (180) and, furthermore, the integral (179) is logarithmically divergent at the
lower limit in this case. It should therefore be regularised. One way to do it is as
follows [25]:

This regularisation is, however, not good enough. That is because the integral
still diverges in the q → 0 limit as

while the physical regularisation is finite in the q → 0 limit and expands as:

Since different limiting processes must lead to the same result, one can simply
substruct the unphysical q → 0 divergence from (183). This leads to the following

result for the correlation function (up to an unessential additive constant):

D< (q) =

(185)

Turning to the problem of analytic continuation, we recall that, according to
the standard approach [26]
D(iωn , p) = D (R) (ω, p)

48

in the upper half-plane. Put another way, one has to substitute
iωn → ω + iδ
(that is provided the resulting function has no ‘accidental’ poles and is otherwise
regular in the upper half-plane - there is no general solution to the analytic
continuation problem.) The resulting function is, by construction, analytic in the
upper half-plane and automatically satisfies the Kramers–Kronig relation.
We need to analytically continue formula (180), or equivalently the function
f (iωn ) =

1

It is easy to see that
f (ω) =
