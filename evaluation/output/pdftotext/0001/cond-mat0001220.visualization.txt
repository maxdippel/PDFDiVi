Introduction

The ergodic hypothesis is fundamental to statistical mechanics. This hypothesis states that the time average of an observable event equals the phase-space average. In practical application, however, problems can arise in various types of simulations if the system must overcome high energy barriers to reach other regions of phase space. In that case, the length of a simulation needed in order to obtain enough statistical samples of all regions of phase space may be extremely long. In the Monte Carlo simulation, the errors arise as a consequence of the finite length of the Monte Carlo walk. This error can be serious in canonical Monte Carlo sampling, especially at low temperatures. This problem, referred as "quasi-ergodicity" by Valleau and Whittington [90m[\cite=VW],[0m appears even in the simplest double well problem, where the two wells are separated by a large barrier [90m[\cite=FFD].[0m

[38;5;1m‖[0m Recently several authors [90m[\cite=Pe] [\cite=TS] [\cite=AS1][0m have proposed a generalized simulated annealing method to locate the global minimum based on the generalized statistical mechanics proposed by Tsallis [90m[\cite=Ts],[0m which can overcome the slow convergence of the traditional simulated annealing method [90m[\cite=KGV][0m based on the standard Monte Carlo scheme. Subsequently, Andricioaei and Straub have pointed out that their generalized Monte Carlo (Tsallis Monte Carlo) [90m[\cite=AS2][0m method may be used to overcome the quasi-ergodicity appearing in the canonical average at constant temperatures.

[38;5;1m‖[0m In this short note we use a new Monte Carlo scheme [90m[\cite=AS2] [\cite=AS3] [\cite=SA][0m based on Tsallis's generalized statistical mechanics [90m[\cite=TS][0m for the calculation of the thermal average of the potential energy of a simple double well potential at constant temperatures. We examine the performance of this new algorithm designed to overcome the quasi-ergodicity.

which can be calculated rigorously by numerical quadrature as a function of the temperature β and the asymmetry parameter γ. We employ the same Monte Carlo procedure of Frantz et al. [90m[\cite=FFD][0m and use the uniform sampling distribution from previous position x to new position x' given by

The step size [38;5;22mΔ[0m can be chosen to be large enough for the one-dimensional problem so that the quasi-ergodicity can be reduced [90m[\cite=FFD].[0m However, we follow Frantz et al. [90m[\cite=FFD][0m and use the scaling [90m[formula],[0m which maintains an approximately 50% acceptance rate at all temperatures β, by considering the application to multidimensional systems. This 50% acceptance is commonly employed in the classical Monte Carlo community [90m[\cite=AT].[0m

[38;5;1m‖[0m Since the error caused by the quasi-ergodicity depends upon the walk initialization, we start the Monte Carlo walk at the global minimum x 1 and at the metastable minimum x α. If the walk starts at the global minimum, then the average potential V will be low if the walk is [90m[[0m[38;5;1mquasiergodic,[0m[90m/[0m[38;5;22mquasi-ergodic,[0m[90m][0m as the distribution associated with the higher energy well around α-minimum will be insufficiently sampled. While the walk is initialized at α, the walk may be trapped at this metastable α-well and the average potential V will be too high.

[38;5;1m‖[0m In figure 3, we show the average potential energy V calculated from (i) the standard Metropolis Monte Carlo and (ii~ iv) the generalized Tsallis [38;5;1m6[0m

[38;5;1m==[0m Monte Carlo algorithm as a function of temperature β. Similar curves can be found in figure 2 of reference [90m[\cite=FFD];[0m however, those authors plotted the results from the usual Metropolis algorithm initialized at the global minimum x 1 and at the random positions. In order to check the quasi-ergodicity of the walk, we instead show two curves initialized at the global minimum x 1 and the metastable α-minimum at x α for each scheme. The average potential V is obtained from 100 independently initialized walks, each consisting of 500 warm-up steps followed by 104 steps with data accumulation. The average energy V calculated from the standard Metropolis algorithm shows large errors due to the quasi-ergodicity. In particular, the walk initialized at the metastable α-minimum greatly overestimates the potential energy. The walk starting from the global minimum also shows noticeable error and underestimates the average energy, as expected.

[38;5;1m‖[0m In contrast to the results from the standard Metropolis algorithm, the results from the generalized Monte Carlo algorithm [90m[\cite=AS2] [\cite=AS3][0m show excellent agreement with the numerically exact result. The walks started from the global minimum x 1 produce the average energy which is almost indistinguishable from the exact result up to the lowest temperature (high β) examined. Even the walk started from the metastable α minimum produces the energies that are fairly accurate up to rather low temperature β 15 for q 1.5, which shows that this generalized algorithm does a much better job than the standard Monte Carlo scheme. The agreement with the exact result is further improved if we increase the value of parameter q from 1.5 (see Figure 3)It should be noted that the probability distribution associated with the parameter q 2 is given by the Cauchy distribution and with q 5 3 by the super-diffusive Lévy distribution [90m[\cite=TS].[0m The theoretical upper boundary is q 3. The quasi-ergodicity can be largely circumvented by the use of Tsallis's generalized statistical mechanics with q 1, as shown in figure 3.

[38;5;1m‖[0m In order to overcome the quasi-ergodicity, the Monte Carlo walk has to pass many times through the energy barrier. Figure 4 compares the time series of the Monte Carlo walk generated by the standard Monte Carlo scheme (q 1) and that of the generalized Monte Carlo scheme. Similar diagrams can be found in reference [90m[\cite=AS3].[0m Although the trajectory of the standard Monte Carlo scheme is mostly confined within the metastable α minimum, the number of barrier crossing of the Tsallis Monte Carlo scheme is significantly greater. This barrier crossing occurs more often when the parameter q is larger. The quasi-ergodicity can be removed by Tsallis's generalized Monte Carlo scheme by increasing the magnitude of the parameter q from [38;5;1m7[0m

[38;5;1m==[0m 1.

[38;5;1m‖[0m In figure 5, we show the average energy V as a function of the asymmetry parameter γ. Again a similar diagram can be found in reference [90m[\cite=FFD].[0m Here again we can clearly observe a large error for the initialization at the metastable α minimum when the standard Monte Carlo procedure is used. In this case, the superiority of Tsallis's generalized Monte Carlo scheme over the traditional one is also obvious.

[38;5;1m‖[0m In table 1 we showed the effect of quasi-ergodicity in the convergence when γ 0.9 and β 10 for both the standard Monte Carlo and the generalized Monte Carlo algorithms with q 1.5, each originating at the metastable α-minimum. We show the average energy V and the standard deviation (STD) obtained from 100 independently initialized walks. We found that the problem of quasi-ergodicity obtained with the standard Metropolis algorithm is still present, even if we increase the number of Monte Carol steps. On the other hand the result from the generalized Monte Carlo simulation is significantly improved by increasing the number of Monte Carlo steps, and ergodicity can be recovered. Furthermore, STD decreases as [90m[formula][0m when the Monte Carlo step N is increased for the generalized Monte Carlo simulation, while such a systemic decrease is not observed for the standard Monte Carlo simulation.

[38;5;1m‖[0m This convergence can be clearly visualized by plotting the visiting probability P(x) of the Monte Carlo walks, which should be given by the Boltzmann weight for the standard Monte Carlo scheme and by the Tsallis weight [90m([\ref=eq:3])[0m for the generalized Monte Carlo scheme. In figure 6, we compare P(x) generated by the standard and generalized Monte Carlo walks with the Boltzmann and the Tsallis weights. The visiting probability P(x) converges rapidly to the Tsallis weight as the number of the Mone Carlo walks is increased for the generalized Monte Carlo scheme. On the other hand, P(x) recovers the Boltzmann weight only when the Monte Carlo steps are increased upto 106 in the standard Monte Carlo scheme.

[38;5;1m‖[0m It is also interesting to discuss the convergence in the context of the "generalized ergodic measure" of Thirumalai, Mountain, and Kirkpatrick [90m[\cite=TMK] [\cite=AS3].[0m Using the energy metric, the ergodic measure dV(n) is defined by

and DV β- q (q 1)We note in figure 8 that η 1.6 for q 1.5 and η 0.85 for q 2.5. These values are close to q (q 1) 3 for q 1.5 and q (q 1) 1.66 if q 2.5. Therefore, the diffusion constant decreases more slowly as a function of the inverse temperature β as β- η for the generalized Monte Carlo scheme, though it decreases exponentially faster for the standard Monte Carlo scheme. The exponent η becomes smaller as q is increased and the diffusion is possible even at low temperatures. This result can be anticipated based on data presented in figures 3 and 6.

Concluding remarks

In conclusion, we found that the so-called "quasi-ergodicity" in a double well potential encountered in the standard Metropolis Monte Carlo algorithm is largely circumvented by the use of the generalized Monte Carlo algorithm of Andricioaei and Straub [90m[\cite=AS2] [\cite=AS3][0m based on Tsallis's [90m[\cite=TS][0m generalized statistical mechanics. Therefore this algorithm will be useful in the Monte Carlo study of any system, in particular, when the first order phase transition occurs. We believe that this algorithm will be useful, for example, in the study of the melting transition of clusters for which the J-walk algorithm [90m[\cite=FFD][0m and the multiple histrogram method [90m[\cite=WA][0m have been utilized. It is also interesting to apply this new algorithm to the problems where the slow dynamics due to randomness or frustration is serious, for example, the spin-glass problems. This generalized Monte Carlo algorithm based on Tsallis's statistical mechanics use the reweighting technique similar to the multicanonical [38;5;1m10[0m

[38;5;1m==[0m method [90m[\cite=BN].[0m But this algorithm is much simpler than the multicanonical methods and appears to be more promising because it does not require an iterative determination of the weighting factor by preliminary Monte Carlo runs.

[38;5;1m‖[0m Recently, a new formulation of the Tsallis statistics has been proposed [90m[\cite=TMP].[0m With a new choice of energy constraint, unfamiliar consequences in the previous formulation have been erased. However, the Lagrange parameter used in the new formulation can be related to that in the previous formulation. Therefore, in performing Monte Carlo simulations with reweighting technique, we may use the previous formulation of the Tsallis statistics.
