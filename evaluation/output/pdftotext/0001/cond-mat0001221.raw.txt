Correlation between orbital structure and magnetic ordering in bilayered manganites is examined.
A level separation between the 3d3z 2 −r2 and 3dx2 −y 2 orbitals in a Mn ion is calculated in the ionic
model for a large number of the compounds. It is found that the relative stability of the orbitals
dominates the magnetic transition temperatures as well as the magnetic structures. A mechanism of
the correlation between orbital and magnetism is investigated based on the theoretical model with
the two eg orbitals under strong electron correlation.

Since the discovery of the colossal magnetoresistance
(CMR), studies of manganites with cubic perovskite
structure have been renewed theoretically and experimentally. Competition and cooperation between spin,
charge and orbital degrees of freedom as well as lattice cause the dramatic changes of transport and magnetic properties. Manganites with bilayered structure
A2−2x B1+2x Mn2 O7 , where A and B are trivalent and
divalent cations, respectively, are another class of CMR
materials [1,2]. Since an extremely large MR is observed
near the transition from paramagnetic (PM) insulator to
ferromagnetic (FM) metal, it has been considered that
several concepts proposed in the cubic compounds are
applicable to the bilayered ones.
In cubic manganites, one of the key factors dominating the magnetic orderings is the tolerance factor [3]; a
bending of a Mn-O-Mn bond decreases the hopping integral of carriers. As a result, the ferromagnetic transition temperature Tc decreases in the double exchange
(DE) scenario. However, in bilayered manganites, the
Mn-O-Mn bond angle is almost unchanged with changing cations and carrier concentration, as shown later, in
spite of a wide variety of the magnetic structures. Various
key factors dominating the magnetic ordering, which are
not included in the DE model, were experimentally suggested, e.g. the antiferromagnetic (AFM) superexchange
(SE) interaction [4], the local lattice distortion [5–8], the
charge and orbital degrees of freedom and their orderings
[9,10] and so on. However, systematics in their correlations for a variety of compounds and their mechanisms
still remain to be clarified.
In this letter, we study the correlation between magnetic ordering and orbital structure in bilayered manganites. The two eg orbitals, i.e. the 3d3z2 −r2 and 3dx2 −y2
orbitals in a Mn3+ ion split in the crystalline field of the
bilayered structure and one of them is occupied by an
electron. It is known that the occupied orbital controls
the anisotropy of the magnetic interaction as well as its
strength. The level separation between the orbitals is
calculated in the ionic model for a large number of the
compounds. We find a universal correlation between the

relative stability of the orbitals and the magnetic transition temperatures as well as the magnetic structures.
A mechanism of the correlation is investigated based on
the theoretical model with the eg orbitals under strong
electron correlation.
We first show that neither the tolerance factor nor the
bond length governs TC and the Néel temperature TN
for the A-type AFM ordering [11]. The tolerance factor
in the bilayered crystals is defined by t = (dO(1)−A(1) +
√
dO(2)−A(2) )/(2 2dMn−O(3) ) where dA−B is a bond length
between A and B ions. The position of each ion is shown
in the inset of Fig. 1(a). Being based on the structural
data obtained by the neutron and x-ray diffraction experiments [12–23], we evaluate t and the bond length between nearest neighboring (NN) Mn ions in the ab plane
dab
Mn−Mn for a variety of compounds. TC and TN are
plotted as functions of t and dab
Mn−Mn in Figs. 1 (a) and
(b), respectively. Almost all t’s are located in a narrow
region where TC ’s and TN ’s are distributed randomly.
In addition, TC is not correlated with dab
Mn−Mn , either.
ab
Although TN increases with increasing dMn−Mn , this correlation is opposite to that predicted by the DE scenario
where, with increasing the bond length, the hopping integral decreases and the FM interaction in the ab plane
decreases. We conclude that the DE model, which includes the change of the hopping integral caused by the
change of the bond angle/length, can not explain TC(N ) .
We also examined correlations between TC(N ) and a number of other quantities: the torelance factor evaluated by
the ionic radius, a Mn-O(3)-Mn bond angle, a Mn-O(1)Mn bond length, Mn-O bond lengths, a lattice spacing
between NN bilayers, lattice constants and the valencebond sum for a Mn ion. However, there are not clear
correlations between these parameters and TC(N ) .
Let us focus on the correlation between TC(N ) and
a relative stability of the eg orbitals. We employ the
ionic model to examine the electronic energy-level structures. This model may be justified by the following
considerations [24]: (1) the manganites at x = 0 are
classified as charge-transfer type insulators in which the
ionic model provides a good starting point [25]. (2) The

represents the relative stability of the orbitals; with increasing ∆V , the energy level of the 3d3z2 −r2 orbital for
an electron relatively decreases.
TN and TC are plotted as functions of ∆V in Fig. 2
where the structural data at room temperature are used.
Broad shades are drawn by considering experimental errors. It is clearly shown that both TC and TN are
correlated with ∆V ; TN increases with decreasing ∆V
and there is an optimal value of ∆V (∼ 0.08 eV) for
TC . We estimate the strength of the correlation between TP
N and ∆V by using the correlation coefficient:
r = N1 l (TN l − TN )(∆Vl − ∆V )/(σTN σ∆V ) where l
indicates a sample and N is the number of samples.
∆V (TN ) and σ∆V (σTN ) are the mean value and the
standard deviation of ∆V (TN ), respectively. We obtain r = −0.89 ± 0.11 for single crystal samples and
r = −0.15 ± 0.04 for all samples including polycrystals. One might think that the TC(N ) v.s. ∆V curve
in Fig. 2 just reflects the relation between TC(N ) and x
in La2−2x Sr1+2x Mn2 O7 (LSMO) [12,7]. However, when
we pay attention to TC(N ) ’s for samples with the same x
(e.g., the samples C and K-R), we notice that the correlation remains. The correlation between TN and ∆V explains that between TN and dab

ion, the two eg orbitals are introduced and the t2g electrons are treated as a localized spin with S = 3/2. The
first two terms in Eq. (6) correspond to the so-called tand J-terms in the tJ model, respectively, with the two
eg orbitals under strong electron correlation. The third
and fourth terms describe the Hund coupling between
eg and t2g spins and the AFM SE interaction between
t2g spins, respectively. The splitting of the energy levels
between 3d3z2 −r2 and 3dP
x2 −y 2 orbitals is represented by
the last term: Hz = −∆ i Tiz where the pseudospin opP
erator is given by T~i = 21 γγ ′ σ d†iγσ ~σγγ ′ diγ ′ σ with diγσ
being the annihilation operator of an eg electron at site
i with spin σ and orbital γ. The +(−) eigenstate of Tiz
corresponds to the state where the 3d3z2 −r2 (3dx2 −y2 )
orbital is occupied by an electron. The anisotropies of
the hopping integral and the SE interactions due to the
layered structure are considered. The explicit expression and derivation of the Hamiltonian are presented in
Refs. [27] and [29].
The calculated magnetic phase diagram at T = 0 is
presented in Fig. 4 [30,31] where the mean field approximation is adopted. We note that the phase diagram
derived in this approximation explains that in the cubic manganites [32]. The characteristic features shown
in Fig. 3 are well reproduced by the present theory; the
A-type AFM phase appears in the region with higher x
and smaller ∆ than that of the FM one. The range of the
horizontal axis in Fig. 4 is larger than that in Fig. 3 by
about 0.25. This discrepancy may be attributed to the
neglect of the orbital fluctuation [33]. However, the characteristics of the phase diagram are insensitive to the parameters in the model. In the FM (A-type AFM) phase,
the orbitals are uniformly aligned with 0 < θ < 0.72π
(0.72π < θ < π) where θ describes the orbital state as
|θi =cos( 2θ )|3d3z2 −r2 i− sin( 2θ )|3dx2 −y2 i. The present results suggest that a dimensionality of the FM interaction
is controlled by the orbital structure; in the A-type AFM
phase, the FM ordering in the ab plane is caused by the

x = 0.3 − 0.5 [12]. In addition, ∆V ’s calculated by using
the data below TC(N ) in LSMO are also plotted. Bold arrows indicate the change of the Madelung potential with
changing temperature from T > TC(N ) to T < TC(N ) :
(5)

We find that the magnetic structures are governed by ∆V
and x; the FM (A-type AFM) phase is located in the region with smaller (larger) x and moderate (smaller) ∆V .
Let us focus on δ(∆V ) in LSMO. δ(∆V )’s are negative
at x = 0.3 and 0.35. The absolute value of δ(∆V ) gradually decreases with increasing x and δ(∆V ) becomes a
small positive value at x = 0.4. Below TC , ∆V seems
to approach to the optimal value of ∆V ∼ 0.08 where
TC becomes maximum as seen in Fig. 2. On the other
hand, δ(∆V )’s are negative at x=0.45 and 0.48 where
the A-type AFM structure appears. The orbital structure and its stability in the FM phase have been studied
by measuring the striction in Ref. [10]. The difference
of the Mn-O bond lengths between PM and FM states
was reported in Ref. [7]. These experimental results are
consistent with the present results of δ(∆V ) in Fig. 3.
Now we theoretically investigate a mechanism of the
correlation between magnetic ordering and orbital structure. We start with the following Hamiltonian [27,29,30]:
H = Ht + HJ + HH + HAF + Hz .

Instead of the bilayered structure, the simple tetragonal
lattice consisting of Mn ions is considered. In this model,
the magnetic structure with FM and AFM alignments
perpendicular and parallel to the c axis, respectively, corresponds to the A-type AFM structure [11]. In each Mn

DE interaction, while the AFM in the c direction is by the
AFM SE. When the 3dx2 −y2 orbital is stabilized, the DE
interaction in the ab plane (c direction) becomes strong
(weak) and the A-type AFM phase appears [34]. A mixing of the orbitals is essential in the FM phase where
the FM interaction overcomes the AFM SE one in the
three directions. We note that, in Fig. 4, the FM phase
appears not around ∆ = 0 but in a region of ∆ > 0,
since the anisotropy in the hopping integral due to the
layered structure stabilizes the 3dx2 −y2 orbital more than
3d3z2 −r2 . It is worth to mention the change of the orbital
structure associated with the magnetic ordering: By utilizing the mean filed approximation at finite temperature,
we compare the orbital structures above and below the
magnetic transition temperatures. It is found that (1)
there is an optimal mixing of the orbitals for the FM
state and the orbital structure tends to approach to this
structure below TC and (2) the 3dx2 −y2 orbital structure
is stabilized below TN . The theoretical results are consistent with δ(∆V )’s shown in Fig. 3 by considering that
the change of ∆V associated with the magnetic ordering
is caused by that of the orbital structure.
In summary, we examine correlation between magnetic
ordering and orbital structure in bilayered manganites.
A relative stability of the eg orbitals is investigated by
calculating the Madelung potentials in a large number of
the bilayered compounds. We find that the A-type AFM
structure and the 3dx2 −y2 orbital one are stabilized cooperatively and there is an optimal mixing between the
3d3z2 −r2 and 3dx2 −y2 orbitals for the FM ordering. A
theory with the two eg orbitals under strong electron correlation explains a mechanism of the universal correlation
between orbital and magnetism.

[11] The following two layered AFM structures have been observed [12,13]: AFM-I consisting of the FM spin ordering in the plane and the AFM (FM) one along the c axis
within (between NN) bilayers, and AFM-II consisting of
the FM in the plane and the FM (AFM) along the c
axis within (between NN) bilayers. Since the intrabilayer
magnetic coupling is much larger than the interbilayer
one [35], we term the AFM-I structure the A-type AFM
one and regard the AFM-II as the FM.
