Abstract
A new Monte Carlo scheme based on the system of Tsallis’s generalized statistical mechanics is applied to a simple double well potential
to calculate the canonical thermal average of potential energy. Although we observed serious quasi-ergodicity when using the standard
Metropolis Monte Carlo algorithm, this problem is largely reduced by
the use of the new Monte Carlo algorithm. Therefore the ergodicity is
guaranteed even for short Monte Carlo steps if we use this new canonical Monte Carlo scheme.

Introduction

The ergodic hypothesis is fundamental to statistical mechanics. This hypothesis states that the time average of an observable event equals the
phase-space average. In practical application, however, problems can arise
in various types of simulations if the system must overcome high energy
barriers to reach other regions of phase space. In that case, the length
of a simulation needed in order to obtain enough statistical samples of all
regions of phase space may be extremely long. In the Monte Carlo simulation, the errors arise as a consequence of the finite length of the Monte
Carlo walk. This error can be serious in canonical Monte Carlo sampling,
especially at low temperatures. This problem, referred as ”quasi-ergodicity”
by Valleau and Whittington [1], appears even in the simplest double well
problem, where the two wells are separated by a large barrier [2].
Recently several authors [3, 4, 5] have proposed a generalized simulated
annealing method to locate the global minimum based on the generalized
statistical mechanics proposed by Tsallis [6], which can overcome the slow
convergence of the traditional simulated annealing method [7] based on the
standard Monte Carlo scheme. Subsequently, Andricioaei and Straub have
pointed out that their generalized Monte Carlo (Tsallis Monte Carlo) [8]
method may be used to overcome the quasi-ergodicity appearing in the
canonical average at constant temperatures.
In this short note we use a new Monte Carlo scheme [8, 9, 10] based
on Tsallis’s generalized statistical mechanics [4] for the calculation of the
thermal average of the potential energy of a simple double well potential at
constant temperatures. We examine the performance of this new algorithm
designed to overcome the quasi-ergodicity.

A generalized Monte Carlo scheme

In the generalized statistical mechanics proposed by Tsallis [6], a crucial role
is played by the generalized entropy Sq defined as
Sq = k

1 − pqi
q−1
P

(1)

where q is a real number which characterizes the statistical mechanics, and
pi is the probability of states i. This entropy Sq becomes the usual GibbsP
Shannon entropy S1 = −k pi ln pi when q → 1. By maximizing the gen2

eralized entropy with the constraints
X

X

pi = 1 and

pqi ǫi = const

(2)

where ǫi is the energy spectrum, the statistical weight for the generalized
canonical ensemble characterized by the parameter q is given by the Tsallis
weight


(3)
pqi = exp −βǫi /Zqq
with
ǫi =

h
i
q
ln 1 − (1 − q)βǫi
β(q − 1)

(4)

where ǫi is the generalized energy and β is the Lagrange multiplier, which
plays the role of the generalized temperature in the Tsallis statistical mechanics. We should note here that the statistical weight is not given by the
probability distribution pi but rather by pqi in order to calculate thermal
averages, as can be seen in (2). The generalized canonical partition function
Zq in (3) is given by


X
Zq =
exp −βǫi /q
(5)
In the limit q → 1, ǫi → ǫi and β → β = 1/kT where T is the usual
temperature [11], then the Tsallis weight (3) becomes the Boltamann weight
pi = exp(−βǫi )/Z1 of the usual canonical ensemble.
In this generalized statistical mechanics, Andricioaei and Straub [5] have
noted that since the average of an observable O is defined by
< O >q =

X

pqi Oi ,

(6)

the detailed balance condition should be written as
pqi Wij = pqj Wji

(7)

where Wij is the element of the transition matrix. Based on this observation,
they [5] pointed out that the generalized Monte Carlo algorithm [4] originally
proposed by Penna [3] in his generalized simulated annealing method cannot
satisfy the detailed balance. They [5] then proposed a new generalized Monte
Carlo scheme, where the acceptance probability p of the Monte Carlo move
is given by
i
h
(8)
p = min 1, exp(−β∆ǫ)

3

which has a similar form to the familiar Metropolis algorithm [12]
p = min [1, exp(−β∆ǫ)]

(9)

where ∆ǫ is the increase of the generalized energy (4) while ∆ǫ is that of
the usual energy. Andricioaei and Straub [5] combined this Monte Carlo
algorithm with the usual simulated annealing technique [7] to optimize the
conformation of tetrapeptides. They showed that their algorithm is more
effective than the standard simulated annealing based on the usual molecular
dynamics or Monte Carlo methods.
Recently, Andricioaei and Straub [8, 9] pointed out that their generalized
Monte Carlo scheme [5] for simulated annealing can also be used to calculate
the standard canonical ensemble averages at constant temperatures

where the sum j runs over to the generalized Tsallis Monte Carlo steps produced by eq.(8) instead of the usual Metropolis algorithm (9). The equation

equation (14) reduces to
P

exp (−β (ǫj − ǫj ))

(15)

which has been used in [8, 9]. From now on, the actual calculation will be
done by choosing β = β.
We would like to point out here that a similar reweighting technique is
used in the histogram method [13] and the multicanonical ensemble method [14].
Andricioaei and Straub applied this Tsallis Monte Carlo algorithm to the
two-dimensional Ising system [8], a classical one-dimensional potential and
a 13-atom Lennard-Jones cluster [9], and showed that this new Monte Carlo
algorithm is more effective than the standard Metropolis algorithm. They
also proposed the generalized molecular dynamics based on Tsallis generalized statistical mechanics [9, 10]

Application to a classical double well potential

In order to check the performance of this new Monte Carlo algorithm [8, 9]
in a classical system such as molecules and liquids, we look at the problem
of a classical particle in a one-dimensional double well potential defined by




V (x) = δ 3x4 + 4(α − 1)x3 − 6αx2 + 1
where
δ=

1
2α + 1

(16)

(17)

which was examined by Frantz et al. [2] to demonstrate the quasi-ergodicity
of the standard Metropolis algorithm. The potential given by (16) has the
double minimum at x = 1 and x = −α; therefore, it represents a symmetrical
double well when α = 1 and a single well when α = 0. This potential is
more conveniently characterized by the parameter γ [2]
V (0) − V (−α)
α+2
γ=
= α3
V (0) − V (1)
2α + 1




(18)

In figure 1, we show the asymmetric double well potential V (x) when γ = 0.9
as well as the equilibrium Tsallis weight pT ∝ exp(−βV (x)), which is renormalized, and Boltzmann weight pB = exp(−βV (x))/Z1 . It is obvious that
5

the statistical weight pT of the Tsallis generalized statistical mechanics has
a greater chance of crossing the barrier and, therefore, a greater possibility
of avoiding quasi-ergodicity.
Alternatively this Tsallis’s statistical mechanics can be regarded as a
search-space smoothing method which deforms the rugged potential landscape by a smoother one. In figure 2, we show the smoothed potential V (x)
calculated from (4), which has a smoother landscape and a lower energy
barrier than the original landscape V (x).
We use this double well potential to look at the quasi-ergodicity of the
standard as well as the generalized Monte Carlo scheme by examining the
classical average potential energy [2]
< V >=

R

V (x) exp (−βV (x)) dx
R
exp (−βV (x)) dx

(19)

which can be calculated rigorously by numerical quadrature as a function of
the temperature β and the asymmetry parameter γ. We employ the same
Monte Carlo procedure of Frantz et al. [2] and use the uniform sampling
′
distribution from previous position x to new position x given by
′

1
∆
′
for |x − x | <
∆
2
= 0 otherwise

T (x |x) =

(20)

The step size ∆ can be chosen to be large enough for the one-dimensional
problem so that the quasi-ergodicity can be reduced
[2]. However, we follow
√
Frantz et al. [2] and use the scaling ∆ = 2.5/ β, which maintains an approximately 50% acceptance rate at all temperatures β, by considering the
application to multidimensional systems. This 50% acceptance is commonly
employed in the classical Monte Carlo community [15].
Since the error caused by the quasi-ergodicity depends upon the walk
initialization, we start the Monte Carlo walk at the global minimum x = 1
and at the metastable minimum x = −α. If the walk starts at the global
minimum, then the average potential < V > will be low if the walk is quasiergodic, as the distribution associated with the higher energy well around
α-minimum will be insufficiently sampled. While the walk is initialized at
−α, the walk may be trapped at this metastable α-well and the average
potential < V > will be too high.
In figure 3, we show the average potential energy < V > calculated from
(i) the standard Metropolis Monte Carlo and (ii∼iv) the generalized Tsallis
6

Monte Carlo algorithm as a function of temperature β. Similar curves can be
found in figure 2 of reference [2]; however, those authors plotted the results
from the usual Metropolis algorithm initialized at the global minimum x = 1
and at the random positions. In order to check the quasi-ergodicity of the
walk, we instead show two curves initialized at the global minimum x = 1
and the metastable α-minimum at x = −α for each scheme. The average
potential < V > is obtained from 100 independently initialized walks, each
consisting of 500 warm-up steps followed by 104 steps with data accumulation. The average energy < V > calculated from the standard Metropolis algorithm shows large errors due to the quasi-ergodicity. In particular,
the walk initialized at the metastable α-minimum greatly overestimates the
potential energy. The walk starting from the global minimum also shows
noticeable error and underestimates the average energy, as expected.
In contrast to the results from the standard Metropolis algorithm, the
results from the generalized Monte Carlo algorithm [8, 9] show excellent
agreement with the numerically exact result. The walks started from the
global minimum x = 1 produce the average energy which is almost indistinguishable from the exact result up to the lowest temperature (high β)
examined. Even the walk started from the metastable α minimum produces
the energies that are fairly accurate up to rather low temperature β ∼ 15
for q = 1.5, which shows that this generalized algorithm does a much better
job than the standard Monte Carlo scheme. The agreement with the exact
result is further improved if we increase the value of parameter q from 1.5
(see Figure 3). It should be noted that the probability distribution associated with the parameter q = 2 is given by the Cauchy distribution and with
q > 5/3 by the super-diffusive Lévy distribution [4]. The theoretical upper
boundary is q = 3. The quasi-ergodicity can be largely circumvented by
the use of Tsallis’s generalized statistical mechanics with q > 1, as shown in
figure 3.
In order to overcome the quasi-ergodicity, the Monte Carlo walk has to
pass many times through the energy barrier. Figure 4 compares the time series of the Monte Carlo walk generated by the standard Monte Carlo scheme
(q = 1) and that of the generalized Monte Carlo scheme. Similar diagrams
can be found in reference [9]. Although the trajectory of the standard
Monte Carlo scheme is mostly confined within the metastable α minimum,
the number of barrier crossing of the Tsallis Monte Carlo scheme is significantly greater. This barrier crossing occurs more often when the parameter
q is larger. The quasi-ergodicity can be removed by Tsallis’s generalized
Monte Carlo scheme by increasing the magnitude of the parameter q from
7

1.
In figure 5, we show the average energy < V > as a function of the asymmetry parameter γ. Again a similar diagram can be found in reference [2].
Here again we can clearly observe a large error for the initialization at the
metastable α minimum when the standard Monte Carlo procedure is used.
In this case, the superiority of Tsallis’s generalized Monte Carlo scheme over
the traditional one is also obvious.
In table 1 we showed the effect of quasi-ergodicity in the convergence
when γ = 0.9 and β = 10 for both the standard Monte Carlo and the generalized Monte Carlo algorithms with q = 1.5, each originating at the metastable
α-minimum. We show the average energy < V > and the standard deviation
(STD) obtained from 100 independently initialized walks. We found that
the problem of quasi-ergodicity obtained with the standard Metropolis algorithm is still present, even if we increase the number of Monte Carol steps.
On the other hand the result from the generalized Monte Carlo simulation
is significantly improved by increasing the number of Monte Carlo steps,
√
and ergodicity can be recovered. Furthermore, STD decreases as ∼ 1/ N
when the Monte Carlo step N is increased for the generalized Monte Carlo
simulation, while such a systemic decrease is not observed for the standard
Monte Carlo simulation.
This convergence can be clearly visualized by plotting the visiting probability P (x) of the Monte Carlo walks, which should be given by the Boltzmann weight for the standard Monte Carlo scheme and by the Tsallis weight
(3) for the generalized Monte Carlo scheme. In figure 6, we compare P (x)
generated by the standard and generalized Monte Carlo walks with the
Boltzmann and the Tsallis weights. The visiting probability P (x) converges
rapidly to the Tsallis weight as the number of the Mone Carlo walks is increased for the generalized Monte Carlo scheme. On the other hand, P (x)
recovers the Boltzmann weight only when the Monte Carlo steps are increased upto ∼ 106 in the standard Monte Carlo scheme.
It is also interesting to discuss the convergence in the context of the ”generalized ergodic measure” of Thirumalai, Mountain, and Kirkpatrick [16, 9].
Using the energy metric, the ergodic measure dV (n) is defined by
2



dV (n) = V a (n) − V b (n)

,

(21)

where V a (n) and V b (n) are the move average of the potential energy V

for the standard Monte Carlo scheme. For an ergodic system, Thirumalai
et al. [16] suggested that the ergodic measure converges as dV (n) → ∞ if
n → ∞. They found that
dV (n) ≃ dV (0)

1
DV n

(24)

where the ”diffusion” constant DV depends on temperature. In figure 7,
we show dV (0)/dV (n) for γ = 0.9 potential obtained from 100 independent
pairs (a, b) of Monte Carlo walks as a function of Monte Carlo steps n. We
chose the trajectory starting from the metastable minimum x = −α (=0.9163) and that from the stable minimum x = 1, respectively, as the two
independent trajectories a and b. It is clear from figure 7 that the normalized
inverse of the ergodic measure dV (0)/dV (n) grows linearly with the Monte
Carlo steps n. Therefore, the ergodic measure dV (n) decreases according to
(24), and the diffusion constant DV can be determined.
Figure 8 shows the diffusion constant DV as a function of temperature β.
The diffusion constant is a decreasing function of the inverse temperature
β; it is more difficult to recover the ergodicity when the temperature is
lowered. However, at lower temperatures β > 20 with β∆V > 1 where
∆V = V (−α) − V (1) = 0.1, the diffusion constant starts to increase again
for the Tsallis Monte Carlo walks (q 6= 1). This is due to the fact that the
equilibrium thermal distribution around the metastable minimum at x = −α
becomes negligibly small at such low temperatures, and the ergodicity of the
trajectory among the stable and the metastable minima is irrelevant once
trajectories a and b both fall into the stable minimum around x = 1.
It is apparent from figure 8 that the diffusion constant DV obtained from
the standard Monte Carlo algorithm obeys the usual activation form
DV ∼ exp (−βEb )
9

(25)

where the activation energy Eb is estimated to be Eb ≃ 0.4, which is the same
order of magnitude as the barrier height (∼ 1) between two wells, as shown
in figure 1. On the other hand, the diffusion constant DV obtained from
the Tsallis generalized Monte Carlo scheme is characterized by a power-law
form
DV ∼ β −η
(26)
with the exponent η. This result is conceivable, based on the acceptance
probability (8) using the Tsallis weight, because
DV

∼ exp(−β Ēb )

∼ [1 − (1 − q)βEb ]−q/(q−1)

(27)

and DV ∼ β −q/(q−1) . We note in figure 8 that η ∼ 1.6 for q = 1.5 and
η ∼ 0.85 for q = 2.5. These values are close to q/(q − 1) = 3 for q =
1.5 and q/(q − 1) = 1.66 if q = 2.5. Therefore, the diffusion constant
decreases more slowly as a function of the inverse temperature β as β −η for
the generalized Monte Carlo scheme, though it decreases exponentially faster
for the standard Monte Carlo scheme. The exponent η becomes smaller as
q is increased and the diffusion is possible even at low temperatures. This
result can be anticipated based on data presented in figures 3 and 6. This
power-law temperature dependence of the diffusion constant DV for q 6= 1
has been pointed out by Straub and Andricioaei [17].

Concluding remarks

In conclusion, we found that the so-called ”quasi-ergodicity” in a double well
potential encountered in the standard Metropolis Monte Carlo algorithm is
largely circumvented by the use of the generalized Monte Carlo algorithm
of Andricioaei and Straub [8, 9] based on Tsallis’s [4] generalized statistical
mechanics. Therefore this algorithm will be useful in the Monte Carlo study
of any system, in particular, when the first order phase transition occurs.
We believe that this algorithm will be useful, for example, in the study of
the melting transition of clusters for which the J-walk algorithm [2] and the
multiple histrogram method [18] have been utilized. It is also interesting
to apply this new algorithm to the problems where the slow dynamics due
to randomness or frustration is serious, for example, the spin-glass problems. This generalized Monte Carlo algorithm based on Tsallis’s statistical mechanics use the reweighting technique similar to the multicanonical
10

method [14]. But this algorithm is much simpler than the multicanonical
methods and appears to be more promising because it does not require an
iterative determination of the weighting factor by preliminary Monte Carlo
runs.
Recently, a new formulation of the Tsallis statistics has been proposed [19].
With a new choice of energy constraint, unfamiliar consequences in the previous formulation have been erased. However, the Lagrange parameter used
in the new formulation can be related to that in the previous formulation.
Therefore, in performing Monte Carlo simulations with reweighting technique, we may use the previous formulation of the Tsallis statistics.

Figure 5: The average potential energy < V > for the temperature β = 10
as a function of the asymmetry parameter γ of the double well potential.
The solid and dotted curves are used the same as in figure 3. We only show
the result and some representative error bars for the cases q = 1 and q = 1.5
of figure 3.

Figure 6: The Visiting probabilities P (x) obtained from (a) the standard
Monte Carlo walk compared with the Boltzmann weight, and (b) the generalized Monte Carlo walks compared with the Tsallis weight (c.f. figure 1).
Probability distribution P (x) generated from the generalized Monte Carlo
scheme can recovers the equilibrium Tsallis weight within short Monte Carlo
steps (a), while it cannot recover the equilibrium Boltzmann weight until
rather long (∼ 106 ) Monte Carlo steps are executed (b).

Figure 7: The normalized inverse of the generalized ergodic measure
dV (0)/dV (n) as a function of the number of Monte Carlo steps n calculated for γ = 0.9 potential at β = 10 using the standard Monte Carlo scheme
(q = 1) and the generalized Monte Carlo scheme (q = 1.5, 2.5). dV (0)/dV (n)
grows linearly with the Monte Carlo steps n and the diffusion is faster for
larger q.

Figure 8: The diffusion constant DV as a function of temperature β. (a) A
straight line of the semi-log plot of DV vs β for the standard Monte Carlo
scheme indicates activation-type diffusion, while (b) straight lines of the loglog plot for the Tsallis Monte Carlo scheme in the high temperature region
indicate slow power-law decrease of the diffusion constant as the temperature
is lowered (larger β).
