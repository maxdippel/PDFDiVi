We study effective-medium approximations for linear composite media by means of a path integral
formalism with replicas. We show how to recover the Bruggeman and Hori-Yonezawa effectivemedium formulas. Using a replica-coupling ansatz, these formulas are extended into new ones which
have the same percolation thresholds as that of the Bethe lattice and Potts model of percolation,
and critical exponents s = 0 and t = 2 in any space dimension d ≥ 2. Like the Bruggeman and
Hori-Yonezawa formulas, the new formulas are exact to second order in the weak-contrast and dilute
limits. The dimensional range of validity of the four effective-medium formulas is discussed, and it
is argued that the new ones are of better relevance than the classical ones in dimensions d = 3, 4 for
systems obeying the Nodes-Links-Blobs picture, such as random-resistor networks.

I. INTRODUCTION

Among various effective-medium formulas used to model the effective behavior of random conducting linear composites, the symmetrical Bruggeman formula [1,2] is undoubtly the most popular. Applied to an insulator/conductor
binary mixture, it predicts a percolation-like transition [3–6] for a volumic fraction of conductor pc = 1/d, where d
is the space dimension. The critical exponents are s = t = 1, and its critical properties are thoroughly discussed in
Ref. [4]. This formula can be interpreted in two ways. On one hand, Milton has shown [7] that it yields the exact
effective conductivity of an ad hoc ideal medium built with a particular hierarchical structure. On the other hand, the
Bruggeman formula can be seen as a first (one-body) self-consistent approximation to general disordered symmetric
cell-materials [8], to which systematic corrections could be worked out. However, the Bruggeman approximation is
very different from a mean-field theory of random conducting media. Indeed, an exact mean-field calculation on the
Bethe lattice [9,10] predicts a percolation threshold pc ∼ 1/(2d) and exponents s = 0 and t = 3. These exponents
are exact for d ≥ 6, as well as the asymptotic behavior of the threshold when d → ∞ (at least, for the hypercubic
lattice [5] to which a continuum theory naturally compares [11]). These values are also obtained in a more systematic
mean-field theory for random resistor networks [12]. The remarkable discrepancy between the mean-field results and
Bruggeman’s formula indicates the ambiguous status of the Bruggeman theory. As a matter of fact, in spite of various
(mostly perturbative) investigations [13–15] in order to precise its theoretical status, the reasons for the peculiar
critical behavior of Bruggeman’s formula are not completely cleared up. More surprisingly, another self-consistent
effective-medium approximation [13,16] due to Hori and Yonezawa (HY), obtained for the same type of media by
means of a completely different approximation scheme (and later derived by functional methods [17]), exhibits the
same exponents s = t = 1 and a similar threshold behavior pc = 1 − exp(−1/d) ∼ 1/d.
Apart from phenomelogical variants, and up to our knowledge, the Bruggeman and HY effective-medium formulas
are the only ones obtained from the equations of electrostatics in continuous media which are able to describe, at least
qualitatively, the overall features of a percolation transition in any dimension. One intriguing question concerns the
possibility of deriving alternative effective-medium formulas from a continuum formulation, which do not lead to the
seemingly unavoidable values s = t = 1 and pc ∼ 1/d. As we show in this paper, such a possibility exists. Our starting
point is the path integral approach recently put forward by Barthélémy and Orland [18], where the effective-medium
problem is recast in a functional form. The problem reduces to compute a free-energy: roughly, the logarithm,
averaged over the disorder, of a functional integral of Boltzmann-like weights, over allowed field configurations (which
include boundary conditions). The average of the logarithm is carried out with the replica method (already used
in Ref. [12]). In Ref. [18], the authors showed that the path integral formulation allows one to easily recover the
second-order weak-disorder expansion of the effective permittivity of nonlinear composites [19].

1

However, this formulation has not yet been used to derive self-consistent estimates. In this paper, we show how
this can be done. After a presentation of the functional approach to the homogeneization problem, and of the
replica method (Sec. II), we discuss self-consistent effective-medium approximations (Sec. III). As usual in such
approximations, a background reference medium is introduced under the form of an ansatz for the energy of the
system, whose parameters are to be determined self-consistently (Sec. III A). The new feature here is that the
ansatz contains a replica-coupling term, whose significance is explained (Sec. III B). The self-consistency conditions
to determine its parameters are next discussed, and two types of effective-medium formulas are identified (Sec. III C):
one in which the replica couplings are cancelled (hereafter referred to as “type 1”), and the other one with non-zero
replica couplings (“type 2”). Two different approximations are then worked out for each type (Sec. IV). It is found
that type 1 generates the Bruggeman and HY formulas, whereas type 2 brings in two new effective-medium formulas
which are “replica coupling counterparts” of the previous ones. They possess exponents s = 0, t = 2, and a threshold
pc ∼ 1/(2d) (Sec. IV B 3). These new formulas are discussed in Sec. V, where numerical results are presented before
we conclude in Sec. VI.
II. PATH INTEGRAL FORMULATION OF THE PROBLEM

The effective properties of a random conducting medium can be defined with the help of the total dissipated power
in the medium [20–22]. In terms of the electric field E(x), the dissipated power w in the system of volume V reads
Z

(1)
dx wx E(x) ,
W [E] =
V

where wx is the local power density.
Hereafter, we take the volume V of the sample equal to one. In heterogeneous materials, wx depends on constitutive
parameters randomly varying from point to point. For linear conducting media with j(x) = σ(x)E(x), where σ is the
local random conductivity and j is the electric current, we have

wx E(x) = σ(x)E 2 (x)/2.
(2)

In the analogous effective permittivity problem the dissipated power is replaced by the stored energy ε(x)E 2 (x)/2 (ε
is the permittivity). For this reason, we shall abusively refer to wx as the “energy density” hereafter. In the nonlinear
problem, wx (E) is a non-quadratic function of E.
An alternative to solving Maxwell’s equations is to minimize the total energy W subjected to the two constraints
[20,21]: (i) E = −∇φ and (ii)E = E0 ; here, the bar stands for a spatial average, and E0 is a constant applied electric
field. The minimum, W ∗ E0 , is expected to be self-averaging, as occurs for the free-energy in disordered systems.
We can therefore write
*
+
W ∗ (E0 ) =

min W [E]

(3)

E=E0
E=−∇φ

where the brackets h·i denote the disorder average. W ∗ (E0 ) is the energy in a homogeneous medium characterized
by an effective constitutive law [20]
hji =

∂W ∗ (E0 )
= σeff E0 .
∂E0

(4)

The second equality defines the effective conductivity of the medium.
The problem thus reduces to computing the average of the constrained minimum of a functional of the electric field.
The electric field derives from a potential and has a fixed mean value. We can rewrite the constrained minimum in
(3) using a path integral

For simplicity, we restrict ourselves to cell materials where the local properties are statistically uncorrelated from
site to site. Volume Rintegrals may

the correspondence dx ↔ v x , where v is an infinitesimal cell volume (which defines the microscopic correlation

Note that our discussion in Sec. III will be specialized to binary disorder for which the constitutive parameters can
take only two values (but the proofs are general). That is, we assume that the local energy density is distributed

The above formalism applies to any form of the energy density, and in particular to nonlinear media [25–28]. A
method for extracting from the path integral the second-order weak-contrast perturbation expansion of the effective
potential W ∗ (E0 ), for nonlinear media, has been introduced in Ref. [18].
III. PRINCIPLE OF SELF-CONSISTENT APPROXIMATIONS

In this paper, we consider the linear problem only. This section is devoted to self-consistent approximations to
W ∗ . We first present the principle for building such approximations through the introduction of a trial Hamiltonian.
Then, we discuss the choice of a trial Hamiltonian with replica couplings. Finally, we explain how to exploit these
replica couplings in order to obtain two kinds of self-consistent formulas.
3

A. Overview

The common ingredient to the approximations discussed below is the introduction of a linear comparison medium
described by a trial Hamiltonian H0 which is quadratic in the electric field and non-random, e.g. the one-parameter
ansatz
Z
X
σ0
dx
E α2 (x),
(16)
H0 =

α
where σ0 > 0 is to be determined by an appropriate self-consistency condition. This Hamiltonian is that of a
(replicated) homogeneous medium, but without couplings between replicas. Its meaning and that of other possible
choices with replica couplings are discussed below.
The partition function hZ n i can be rewritten as

or, with another notation

(18)

W ∗ = W0 + ∆W,

(19)

where Z0 is the partition function associated to H0 , and h·i0 stands for the functional average with weights e−βH0 /Z0 .

(20)
(21)

The quantity ∆W (E0 ) is difficult to compute (an exact evaluation would lead to the exact result for the effective
conductivity), and we have to resort to approximations.
A natural self-consistency condition for H0 is
∆W (E0 ) = 0,

(22)

which completely determines H0 in the case where it depends on one single parameter, as in (16). For more general
choices of H0 with several free parameters, (22) only provides a relation between these parameters, and additional
considerations are in order to determine them all. First of all, we have to precise the form of the ansatz to be used
in our calculations.
B. Replica couplings and choice of the ansatz

We deduce here the form of the trial Hamiltonian H0 from an analysis of the effective Hamiltonian He . Eq. (12)
shows that the effective Hamiltonian is non-random but that the average over disorder introduced a coupling between
different replicas. The meaning of these couplings is more transparent if we carry out an expansion of (12) around
the average field E = E0 as in the weak-contrast expansion [18]. With ∂i = ∂/∂Ei and ∆E α = E α − E0 we have
He = nhwx (E0 )i

(25)

The first non-zero replica-coupling term is proportional to βc(2) . We thus see that the coupling between replicas acts
only within clusters defined by n-point connected correlation functions c(n) , and accounts for the fluctuations of the
electric field in these clusters. The replica coupling would vanish if there were no disorder at all. In the limit where
the size of the region defined by c(2) shrinks to zero – which means that the system is observed at a macroscopic level,
we can approximate
(2)

(2)

cij (x − y) ≃ vcij (0)δ(x − y),

which could directly be obtained from (13). The presence of v in front of the replica coupling term is the macroscopic
remnant of a microscopic average having been taken within a two-particle cluster, of center x and volume v. This
discussion therefore enlightens a relation between replica coupling and the electric field fluctuations within clusters.
Expansion (27) suggests a two-parameter replica-symmetric ansatz of the form
Z

dx M αγ Eiα Eiγ ,
(28)
H0 =

where
M αγ = σ0 δαγ − vβQE02 .

(29)

The free parameters are σ0 and Q. Note that Q has the dimension of a squared conductivity, because it is related to
a quantity relative to two points. For simplicity, the ansatz M is diagonal in the euclidean vector space. However,
(2)
we tried calculations with a tensorial structure reproducing that of aij and cij in Eqs. (24), (25); but, apart from a
different normalization for Q, no differences showed up in the final effective-medium theories (as far as linear media
are concerned).
An interesting feature of the ansatz (29) is that, though being non-random, it embodies underlying disorder through
its replica couplings. In order to understand this point, we compute W0 (E0 ) given by (20)

where volume averages E 2 have been replaced by statistical ones, the microscopic size v 1/d being much smaller than
that of the system, V 1/d = 1. All the replicas are equivalent, and the functional average h·i0 selects in the limit
β → ∞ the real field in the medium. Hence, setting ∆E = E − E0 , the previous equation leads to
Q

2

σ0

(33)

which implies that Q ≥ 0. When Q 6= 0, the electric field fluctuates in the medium, whereas it is uniform when
Q = 0. The ansatz H0 therefore represents a medium which is homogeneized (because it is non-random), but which
nonetheless accounts for field fluctuations. We thus expect new effective medium approximations when the replica
coupling Q is non zero.
5

C. Self-consistency

Up to this point the discussion focused on the ansatz itself, without referring to He . In particular, σ0 was treated
as a mere number. We now discuss what happens when self-consistency is imposed, within some approximation
scheme. The medium is made of N phases labelled by ν, of respective conductivities σν and volume concentrations
pν . The self-consistency relation ∆W (E0 ) = 0, which imposes constraints on the ansatz, determines Q as a function
Q = Q(σ0 , {σν }). Then W ∗ = W0 and, with (4),


Q(σ0 , {σν })

(34)
σeff = σ0 1 −

Suppose now that σ0 = σ0 ({σν }) is determined by an additional condition (to be precised below). Using the exact
formula [30] (cf. Appendix A)

where the last derivative is performed at constant σ0 . This expression distinguishes between different contributions to
the field fluctuations: (i) the first term represents fluctuations coming from the “macroscopic” background effective
medium σ0 ; (ii) the second one is that already found in (33), and would be the only one if Q were independent from
σ0 , and if σ0 were equal to hσi, the trivial value corresponding to a non-fluctuating reference medium for a multiphase
composite, cf. Appendix A; (iii) and finally a third term comes from the dependence of Q on σ0 and σν . Both last
terms are, according to the interpretation of replica coupling developped in the previous section, of “microscopic”
origin.
We now turn to the determination of σ0 ({σν }). A first obvious self-consistency condition for σ0 is Q ≡ 0, so that
σeff = σ0 . The effective-medium formulas obtained this way are referred to as “type 1” hereafter. As is shown below,
to this type pertain the Bruggeman and HY formulas.
′
“Type 2” effective-medium formulas are obtained by taking σ0 as the solution of σeff
(σ0 ) = 0, and by using this
value in σeff . According to (36), this procedure makes the effective-medium insensitive to the fluctuations generated
in the reference medium σ0 , so that relevant fluctuations only come from Q.
IV. TWO APPROXIMATIONS

In this section, the ideas introduced above are used within two different approximations to ∆W (E0 ), based on the
ansatz (28), (29). For each approximation to ∆W , “type 1” and “type 2” formulas are obtained. Herafter, q = Q/σ02 ,
so that
σeff = σ0 (1 − q).

(37)

A. One-impurity approximation

We first consider a “one-impurity” (or “local”) calculation. The Bruggeman formula emerges as the “type 1”
effective-medium formula in this approximation, which is not suprising since it can be seen as a one-site (self-consistent)
theory [13,15].

6

1. Approximation scheme

The approximation for ∆W (E0 ) [Eq. (21)], detailed in Appendix B, is a one-impurity approximation where interactions between different points are ignored. Let us denote by w0 the trial Hamiltonian density, which depends on all
the replicas, defined from (28), (29) by
Z
H0 ≡ dx w0 [E(x)].
(38)
Here and in Appendix B, the notation [·] indicates a dependence with respect to all the replicas. Setting


∆wx [E(x)] =

Because of statistical translation invariance, the final result is independant of the point x. The right-hand side can
be computed exactly for any potential wx in the limit β → ∞ using a saddle-point method. Setting ∆σ = σ − σ0 and

2. Type 1 formula: Bruggeman’s

Letting q ≡ 0 amounts to imposing h∆σµi = 0, which is nothing but the Bruggeman equation


σ − σ0

σ + (d − 1)σ0

(44)

The Bruggeman equation can also be written hµi = 1, or σ0 = hσµi if d 6= 1, or σ0 = hσµi/hµi. The last expression is
suitable for computing σ0 iteratively (starting, e.g., from σ0 = hσi) in any dimension. The Bruggeman conductivity
σeff = σ0 possesses a percolation threshold pc = 1/d, and critical exponents s = t = 1 [4].
The fluctuations computed from (35) read

(46)

Like Bruggeman’s, this equation is easily solved by iterations starting from σ0 = hσi. The iterations then always

converge to the physical solution, which we denote by σ0∗ . The effective conductivity thus is σeff = σ0∗ 1 − q(σ0∗ ) . To
study its critical behavior, we consider a binary mixture, where σ = σ1 with probability (1 − p), and σ = σ2 with
probability p. In the conductor/superconductor limit where σ2 → ∞ we find, setting pc = 1/(2d − 1),

(48)

The critical concentration pc can be interpreted as a percolation threshold, and is the same as that obtained in the
mean-field model on a Bethe lattice [12] with connectivity z = 2d. Since σeff = 2(2d − 1)σ1 /(d − 1) ∼ (pc − p)0 for
p<
∼ pc , the superconductivity exponent is s = 0. Note however that σ0 displays a square-root cusp at p = pc . The
critical behavior for p > pc is obtained by exmining the insulator/conductor mixture where σ2 is finite and σ1 = 0.

(50)

Since σeff ∼ (p − pc )2 for p >

For the special case of d = 1, µ = σ0 /σ so that (46) reduces to σ0 = h1/σi−1 , and q = 0. Therefore, σeff = h1/σi−1 ,
which is the exact result. Like Bruggeman’s, the new formula is also exact to second order in the contrast, in any

In the discussion (Section V), it is argued that because of its exponents s 6= t, and because it is less trivial than
the Bruggeman formula (especially in the insulator/conductor case where it does not reduce to a straight line), this
formula may constitute an easy-to-handle alternative to the latter in dimensions d ≥ 3. Graphical comparisons
between different effective-medium formulas are discussed in Sec. V.
B. Cumulant series approximation

In this section, we show how to recover by means of a cumulant approximation to ∆W the effective-medium formula
of HY, together with its “type 2” counterpart.

We first consider the case with no couplings between replicas, i.e. q = 0. The HY formula for σ0 reads

(58)

and the effective conductivity is σeff = σ0 . It can be shown that σeff displays a percolation threshold pc = 1−exp(−1/d),
and exponents s = t = 1 [16]. Applying (35) and using (C12), the fluctuations read

ln(1 − p) − σ1 /(dσ0 ) and a similar equation for h1 , so that (61) reduces to a second-degree polynomial equation. Its

This percolation threshold is the same as the one obtained in the Potts model at the mean-field level, and in the

Since σeff ∝ (pc − p)0 for p <

In the opposite insulator/conductor case, where σ1 = 0 and σ2 is finite, the solution for p > pc can only be found
perturbatively around the percolation threshold. Expanding the logarithm in h0 and h1 as

where the conductivity exponent is t = 2. Hence, as in the previous “one-impurity” approximation, the replicacoupling ansatz yields critical exponents s = 0, t = 2, and an asymptotic dependence of the threshold pc ∼ 1/(2d)
when 2d ≫ 1. One can easily check that this new “type 2” effective-medium formula is exact to second order in the
weak-contrast limit and in the dilute limit.

V. DISCUSSION

We plot in Fig. 1 (resp. 2) the “type 2” scaled conductivities σeff /σ1 versus p, the volume fraction of material 2, for
a dielectric ratio σ2 /σ1 = 10 (resp. σ2 /σ1 = 1000). We also show the Hashin-Shtrikman (HS) bounds [31], the HoriYonezawa formula which comes from a cumulant series (CS) approximation, and the one-impurity (OI) Bruggeman
formula. The dimension is d = 2. Figs. 3 and 4 display similar plots for d = 3.
For moderate contrast (Figs. 1 and 3), we observe that all four self-consistent formulas lie close to each other. This
is a consequence of the fact that they are exact to second order in the contrast. Also, for any contrast, the slopes
at p = 0 and p = 1 are all identical, which is a consequence of the fact that they are exact to second order in the
dilute limit p → 0 (the expression near p = 1 is obtained by replacing p by p − 1 and by interchanging σ1 and σ2 ).
We also observe that the HS bounds are satisfied in each case considered. However, the formulas obtained via the
cumulant series summation, i.e. both the HY formula and its “type 2” counterpart, do not reduce to the exact result
σeff = h1/σi−1 in dimension 1 (not shown). This exact result is also the common value of the HS bounds for d = 1.
Hence, formulas derived from the cumulant series approximation do not obey the HS bounds in dimension d = 1. On
the other hand, both the Bruggeman formula and its “type 2” counterpart do reduce to the exact result when d = 1,
and can be seen to always obey the HS bounds whatever d is. The one-impurity approximation scheme therefore
appears to be of better physical relevance for all dimensions, than the cumulant series approximation.
10

We now discuss thecritical behavior. First of all, the percolation thresholds found in the“type 2” formulas are
pc = 1 − exp −1/(2d) (cumulant series) and pc = 1/(2d − 1) (one-impurity). These thresholds are the percolation
thresholds of the Potts model, and that of the Bethe lattice model, respectively. Both thresholds decrease as 1/(2d)
when d → ∞, which is the exact asymptotics. The Bethe and Potts models are mean-field models, where emphasis
is put on fluctuations in the couplings between a given site and its neighbours. On the contrary, in effective-medium
theories, interactions between impurities are taked into account through the self-consistent background medium. Such
interactions are more important for low dimensions. Effective-medium theories therefore overestimate interactions
in high dimensions, whereas mean-field models are expected to underestimate them in low dimensions. Above the
upper critical dimension where mean-field models are accurate, interactions between impurities become irrelevant.
According to this discussion, our “type 2” formulas appear as hybrids between mean-field and usual effective-medium
theories, and are expected to be mostly relevant in dimensions intermediate between d = 1 and the upper critical
′
dimension d = 6. Indeed, the condition σeff
(σ0 ) = 0 minimizes the influence of the background medium and, according
to the interpretation developped in Sec. III B, replica coupling has to do with couplings between neighboring points.
The reason for which the introduction of a replica-coupling ansatz yields the exact thresholds
of mean-field theories



2
will have to be clarified in the future. In Fig. 5, we plot the quadratic fluctuations ∆E 2 / hEi as a function of p.
The fluctuations in the “type 2” estimates are greatly reduced compared to those of the Bruggeman and HY formula.
This is consistent with the fact that the influence of the background is reduced.
“Type 1” formulas give exponents s = t = 1, while for “type 2” formulas they are s = 0, t = 2. Mean-field theories
yield s = 0, t = 3 which are the exact values for d ≥ 6. It is interesting to compare these values to exact bounds
deduced from the Nodes-Links-Blobs (NLB) model, in all dimensions. The NLB model is currently accepted as a
good one for the backbone structure of real random resistor networks [5]. The bounds read
t ≥ 1 + (d − 2)ν,
s ≥ 1 + (2 − d)ν,

(70a)
(70b)

where ν > 0 is the correlation length exponent: ξ ∝ |p − pc |−ν . They hold for 2 ≤ d ≤ 6, whereas for d > 6 the
right-hand sides in (70) are fixed to their d = 6 values. These bounds follow, e.g., from comparing the lower and upper
exact bounds obtained in Ref. [32] for the noise exponent κ in weakly nonlinear networks, within the NLB scheme.
They are satisfied by simulation results [32]. Using the usual effective-medium values s = t = 1 in (70) implies the
absurd value ν = 0, save for d = 2 where a finite value of ν is allowed. Though information about the correlation
length ξ (and therefore about ν) is not included in the Bruggeman nor in the HY formulas, the above bounds show
that, as long as they are meant to model percolating systems obeying the NLB picture, these formulas are truly
adequate only in dimension d = 2 – and d = 1 where the Bruggeman formula is exact. As to “type 2” formulas, we
insert the values s = 0, t = 2 into (70) and deduce that ν = 1/(d − 2), a reasonable expression for d ≥ 3 only. If we
furthermore insist on having ν ≥ 1/2 as in real systems, these heuristic arguments restrict the range of validity of the
new formulas to d = 3, 4. Note, moreover, that only in dimension d = 2 are the exponents equal: s = t, because of
self-duality [33]. A formula with unequal exponents therefore is expected to be essentially relevant to dimensions ≥ 3.
We also quote theoretical bounds for t due to Golden, valid for hierarchical NLB models: 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 for d = 2, 3
and 2 ≤ t ≤ 3 for d ≥ 4 [34]. The above analysis is consistent with these bounds, and can be summarized as a set of
prescriptions for using the “best” available effective medium theories, as far as a non-conflicting critical behaviour is
concerned: for d = 1, Bruggeman’s formula, or its “type 2” counterpart are exact; for d = 2, the Bruggeman or HY
formulas are adequate; for d = 3, 4, “type 2” formulas are applicable; finally, for d ≥ 5 mean-field theories would be the
most relevant. Estimates or exact values for the exponents are [5]: (ν, s, t) = (4/3, 1.3, 1.3)d=2, (0.88, 0.73, 2.00)d=3,
(0.68, 0.4, 2.4)d=4, (0.57, 0.1, 2.7)d=5, (1/2, 0, 3)d≥6. These values support our prescriptions.
An interesting observation is that actually both “type 1” and “type 2” formulas can be given by a variational
formulation as
type 1
σeff
=
type 2
σeff
=

min

σeff (σ0 ),

(71)

max

σeff (σ0 ),

(72)

σ0 ≥0
0≤q(σ0 )≤1

σ0 ≥0
0≤q(σ0 )≤1

provided that an unphysical solution σeff = 0 is discarded in the minimization (71). Indeed, at least in the framework
of the two different models introduced in Sec. IV, the curves for q(σ0 ) and σeff (σ0 ) are found to have the form shown
′
(σ0 ) = 0 corresponds to a
in Fig. 6. The infimum (71) occurs at q = 0, whereas the solution σ0∗ to the equation σeff
maximum of σeff . Both types of theories can therefore be interpreted as extremal theories in the framework of selfconsistent models built on the replica-coupling ansatz. The physical meaning of this interpretation is still not clear.
However, “type 2” formulas should not been disregarded as unphysical because of their showing up as maximal ones:
11

the minimization principle states that the dissipated power is minimized with respect to the electric field; but there
is no reason why an extremization with respect to arbitrary variational parameters should not lead to a maximum of
type 1
type 2
the dissipated power. Eqs. (71), (72) explain why for a given approximation, one always has σeff
≤ σeff
in Figs.
1-4.
We now consider some points that were not explicitly treated in the paper. First, we presented the formalism in
terms of the electric field E, from which we obtained a conductivity σeff . The electric current j (or the induction D),
could be used instead [18]. In such a formulation, the random constitutive parameter is the resistivity ρ(x) = 1/σ(x)
and the constraints are ∇ · j = 0 and j = j0 . One then computes an effective resistivity ρeff . Both formulations are
equivalent, but a given approximation scheme in general leads to different results for σeff and σ̃eff = 1/ρeff . Preliminary
investigations of “type 2” formulas have been led in this case. These will be presented elsewhere. Finally, we discuss
the natural question about the possibility of replica-symmetry breaking [35]. Replica symmetry breaking introduces
more free parameters in the ansatz, and the final extremization has to be carried out with respect to several variables.
There is no frustration in this problem, and we therefore expect the replica symmetric solution to be the only one.
In order to test this, we tried a one-step symmetry-breaking solution and did indeed not find any new solution.
VI. CONCLUSION

We presented a functional approach to the calculation of effective-medium properties of random media. We showed
how to recover the Bruggeman and Hori-Yonezawa formulas by using specific approximation schemes to the basic
functional integral. We also discussed the introduction of a replica-coupling parameter in a gaussian Ansatz, from
which new effective-medium formulas were obtained. These formulas appear to be more adequate in d = 3 compared
to the standard ones by Bruggeman and HY. Because it yields a sensible result in all dimensions, and fulfills all
the constraints required to deserve the label of a “good” effective-medium theory, the “type 2” counterpart of the
Bruggeman formula offers an interesting alternative to the latter. Indeed, it has a percolation threshold equal to
pc = 1/5 in three dimensions. This is closer to values observed in real materials, compared to the pc = 1/3 of the
Bruggeman formula which often constitutes an overestimation.

APPENDIX A: QUADRATIC FLUCTUATIONS OF THE FIELD

For completeness, we give here the demonstration
of Eq. (35) [30]. Volume averages are identified to statistical
P
ones. Because W ∗ = (1/2)hσE 2 i = (1/2) ν pν σν hE 2 iν , where h·iν denotes an average on the phase ν on which the
conductivity σν is constant, the effective conductivity reads
σeff =

Comparing both equations yields the values of the hE 2 iν and consequently that of hE 2 i = ν pν hE 2 iν . Equ. (35)
follows. We note that if σeff = hσi (an exact upper bound for the effective conductivity), then h∆E 2 i = 0. Therefore,
σeff = hσi defines a trivial model of a medium which is a composite, but from which field fluctations are nonetheless
absent.

where a one-impurity-type integral is involved. Since the fundamental size of the theory (∼ v 1/d ) is much smaller
than the volume V = 1 of the system, and since the latter is statistically translation-invariant, the outer integral over
y is redundant with the disorder average, and can be dropped. We therefore arrive at (40).
When β → ∞, the functional I(y) can be computed exactly. Let us briefly indicate how to do it. We first

FIG. 6. Rescaled effective conductivity σeff (σ0 )/σ1 , and reduced replica coupling parameter q(σ0 ) vs. σ0 in dimension
d = 3 for a binary medium. In this exemple computed from
Eqs. (37), (43), the conductivity ratio is σ2 /σ1 = 100, and
the volume fraction p of component 2 is p = 0.18. The “type
1” effective conductivity is obtained when q = 0, whereas the
“type 2” effective conductivity corresponds to the maximum
of the curve σeff (σ0 ).
