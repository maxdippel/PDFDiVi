We measured the complex dielectric constant in mats of single-wall carbon-nanotubes between
2.7 K and 300 K up to 0.5 THz. The data are well understood in a Drude approach with a negligible temperature dependence of the plasma frequency ωp and scattering time τ with an additional
contribution of localized charges. The dielectric properties resemble those of the best ”metallic”
polypyrroles and polyanilines. The absence of metallic islands makes the mats a relevant piece in
the puzzle of the interpretation of τ and ωp in these polymers.

Depending on the wrapping of the graphene sheet,
the intrinsic electronic properties of single-wall carbonnanotubes (SWNTs) are either semiconducting (zigzag
and most chiral nanotubes) or metallic (armchair and
part of the chiral nanotubes) [1,2]. Single ropes of armchaired SWNTs as well as entangled networks (mats)
show a decrease of the dc conductivity, σdc , with increasing temperature (T ) for T above a critical temperature (T ∗ ) [3–6]. For T < T ∗ , σdc decreases with
cooling. T ∗ typically lies between 40 K and 250 K and
depends on the morphology and the degree of disorder
[4]. The transition from dσdc /dT < 0 to dσdc /dT > 0
at T ∗ is ascribed to structural defects and built-in impurities of the individual nanotubes [7,8], or to barriers
between the nanotubes or ropes limiting the extension
of the charge-carrier states [5]. Additional information
about this issue can be obtained from frequency- dependent phase-sensitive permittivity experiments, giving the
complex conductivity σ(ω) = σ ′ (ω) + iσ ′′ (ω) or dielectric
constant, ǫ(ω) = ǫ′ (ω) − iǫ′′ (ω) [9]. Different frequency
dependencies of σ ′ and ǫ′ are expected for the two limiting cases of localized and delocalized charge transport
and also the sign of ǫ′ changes with the two models. Here
we apply this method to mats of SWNTs. The data do
not need Kramers-Kronig analysis, which is a great advantage for the analysis of the response of the delocalized charge carriers [10]. Like heavily doped polymers
SWNTs are shown to be an example of a system with
exceptional long scattering times τ and low plasma frequencies ωp , but in contrast to the polymers metallic islands can be excluded as an explanation. For that reason
SWNTs form an important new element in the not-yet
understood physics behind τ and ωp .

with d the dimensionality of the transport system, r the
charge-carrier position and hi the configurational average. Eq. (1) reduces to Fick’s law for a frequency independent D. With increasing frequency σ ′ will increase
while the positive ǫ′ decreases [12,13]. In the delocalized
case charge transport is expected to follow the scheme of
a Drude electron-gas with a conductivity:

with ωp2 = nq 2 /(ǫ0 m∗ ) [14]. For most metals ωp ∼ 1015
s−1 . If charge transport is governed by (anomalous)
diffusion (Eq.(1)), dσ ′ /dω ≥ 0 and ǫ′ ≥ 1. In contrast, the Drude model of delocalized charge transport
(Eq.(2)) predicts ǫ′ < 0 for ω ≪ ωp and dσ ′ /dω ≤ 0 and
dǫ′ /dω ≥ 0 for ω ∼ τ −1 .
SWNT mats [15] were prepared by vacuum-filtering a
suspension of SWNT’s in water with approx. 0.5 % Triton X-100, a non-ionic surfactant, through filter paper
with a pore size of 1 µm. The SWNT’s were produced
using laser-ablation [16]. Purification of the mats was
performed by washing the filter paper with the attached
SWNT mat with deionized water to remove the Triton X100 and with methanol to remove residual NaOH [17]. In
this way, mats with a diameter of 34 mm and a thickness
of typically 10 µm were obtained. Some of these SWNT
mats were investigated with the filter paper attached to
it. Other mats could be peeled off the filter paper. Up to
now SWNT mats are always mixtures of chiral, zig-zag
and armchaired nanotubes. The fraction of metallic nanotubes is estimated to be of the order of 0.1-0.5 [3,6,18].
For these strand-like materials such numbers are sufficiently high to be well above the percolation threshold
for dc-conduction [13].
The dc conductivity (σdc ) of the mats was measured
with the four-probe technique. The T -dependent dc measurements were performed in an Oxford flow (down to 4

Weak inter-nanotube contacts or strong intrananotube defects might lead to charge localization. The
motion of the localized charge carriers will be diffusion controlled and the frequency-dependent conductivity σ(ω) = (ne2 /kB T )D(ω) is given by linear response

K) and a 3 He cryostat (down to 0.4 K). Complex σ(ω) or
ǫ(ω)-data in the GHz regime were obtained by runningwave transmission-measurements with the electric-field
vector parallel to the plane of the mat. The transmission
and the phase shift introduced by the sample were directly measured with an ABmm millimeter-wave network
analyzer. The complex dielectric constant at the given
ω could be obtained by fitting the data to first principles formulae [19] without the need of a Kramers-Kronig
analysis. The attenuation of the samples was approximately 45 dB. For the transmission experiments at 10
GHz and at 15 GHz, resp. X-band and P-band rectangular waveguides were used. The sample was mounted
onto a choke flange of the waveguides. Between 40 GHz
and 500 GHz a free-space electromagnetic wave, focused
with polyethylene lenses was transmitting the SWNT
mat. For the T -dependent measurements at 285 GHz
the SWNT mat was mounted in an optical He-flow cryostat. The mm-wave reached the sample by passing two
quartz and capton windows with a diameter of 40 mm.
The sample space of the cryostat was filled with liquid He
for measurements below 4.2 K. The resulting change of
ǫ of the medium surrounding the sample was considered
in the analysis.

To study the influence of inter-rope barriers, desiccated
SWNT mats were prepared by evaporating the water after casting the suspension onto a quartz substrate. After
desiccation, the remaining surfactant covers the SWNTropes. Fig. 4 shows the dielectric constant to be positive for such an unpurified SWNT mat. After rinsing
the mat with deionized water and methanol, the chargetransport properties turned from a localized-carrier dominated regime with ǫ′ > 0, dǫ′ /dω < 0 and dσ ′ /dω > 0
for the unpurified sample to a delocalized-carrier dominated (metallic) regime with an increased σdc , ǫ′ < 0,
dǫ′ /dω < 0 and dσ ′ /dω < 0, see Fig. 4.

Clearly visible is the change from a positive dσ /dT
at low T to a negative dσ ′ /dT at high T . The transition temperatures between the two regimes is close to
T ∗ = 120 K in agreement with recently reported values for similar prepared SWNT mats [3] (for the uncleaned mat T ∗ ∼ 200 K). The measured frequency dependences of ǫ′ and σ ′ show the following main features,
see Fig 2: the conductivity almost keeps its dc value up
to about 10 GHz and decreases at higher frequencies.
Saturation is observed close to 1 THz. The dielectric
constant increases from ǫ′ ∼ −104 in the 10 GHz-regime

Using the Fermi velocity of graphite, vF = 8×105 m/s,
the scattering time τ gives a mean free path of Λ ∼ 3 µm.
A similar value has been estimated from ESR measurements at 100 K on SWNT mats [6]. From DC measurements on an isolated SWNT at a few mK Λ = 3 µm
is suggested as a lower limit [22]. Although theoretical
arguments [23] predict a very low scattering probability
with acoustic phonons inside a tube, which might allow
similar values also at higher temperatures, the Λ found
here refers to 3D transport, for which such a value seems
(far) too high. We will return to this problem below.
The obtained plasma frequency is about one percent
of ωp for normal metals. Assuming m∗ = me , the value
of ωp implies a charge-carrier density n = 3 − 9 × 1023
m−3 . Correcting for the lower density of the mats (∼ 0.65
g/cm3 ) compared to that of a SWNT (∼ 2 g/cm3 ) and
assuming a fraction of 50% metallic tubes [6] would give
n ∼ 4 × 1024 m−3 , comparable to graphite. However,
for SWNT n is predicted to be about 102 × higher [24].
Fischer et al. [3] found after mass-density corrections a
more than 10× higher σdc for single ropes than for mats.
It is plausible that in a mat only a fraction of the charge
carriers present participate in the delocalized (metallic)
charge transport, while due to localization the remaining
charge carriers have a smaller contribution to σdc [25].
In the model proposed here localized charge carriers are
incorporated and contribute to σb .
′
At T = 300 K σ285GHz
is mainly due to σb , i.e. localized charge carriers (see fit in Fig.2). At such a high
frequency σ ′ (ω) might well be determined by photon- in
stead of phonon-assisted hopping [26,21], which explains
′
the constant value of σ285GHz
(T ) for T ≤ 102 K . How′
ever, ǫ is still dominated by the delocalized charges over
the whole temperature range (ǫ′ < 0 at 285 GHz, Fig. 3).
The decrease by 40 % of |ǫ′ | between 70 K and 2.7 K
can be accounted for by the decrease of carriers from the
semiconducting tubes and a growing contribution of localized states. It shows that the metallic part of ǫ′ (ω) for
ω > 1/τ has no strong T dependence, which implies an
almost T independence of ωp . Also σdc at 0.4 K is only a
factor 0.7 lower than at 300 K, which indicates that not
only ωp but also τ have not changed appreciably with
T . An opening of a gap due to twistons in the order
of 20 meV as suggested by Kane and Mele [20] seems
therefore unlikely. Based on the measured metallic lowtemperature behavior down to 4.2 K of the thermoelectric
power in SWNT ropes, Hone et al. [27] also excluded the
opening of a gap at low T [28].
The room temperature data presented in Fig. 4 confirm the importance of inter-rope contacts at low temperatures. The purification procedure removed the surfactant and other impurities from the surface of the SWNT
ropes allowing better contacts between ropes. Intra-tube
or intra-rope transport are likely not changed by the purification, meaning that charge-localization effects due
to defects in the graphene-sheet pattern of the tubes or
bending of them should be unaffected. The effect of the
purification on σdc (T ), see Fig. 1, supports the picture.

FIG. 4. Frequency dependence of σ ′ and ǫ′ for a desiccated
SWNT mat before (full circles) and after (open circles) purification at 300 K. The charge transport is dominated by localized carriers in the unpurified mat and shows metallic properties after purification.

The peculiar T dependence of σdc has been explained
as a transition from metallic charge-transport at high
temperatures to a non-metallic regime at low temperatures caused by charge-transport barriers of the order of
some 10 meV [20]. Such a model is expected to give a
thermally activated behavior of the conductivity at very
low temperatures. In our data (see Fig. 1) σdc (T ) flattens below 10 K showing the model to be too crude.
The metallic nature at room temperature is supported
by the negative dielectric constant obtained from the
high-frequency dielectric measurements, and dσ ′ /dω ≤ 0
and dǫ′ /dω ≥ 0 for ω ∼ τ −1 , see Fig. 2. A qualitative
discrepancy between the observed frequency dependencies and the Drude behavior lies in the saturation of σ ′
for ω > τ −1 . The high-frequency conductivity remains
at approx. 40 % of σdc . This points to a backgroundconductivity, σb , due to localized charge carriers present
in the system. A possible increase with frequency of this
background [21] (here neglected) will enhance the Drude
response at the lowest frequencies at most by a factor
of 2. The positive contribution to ǫ′ (also neglected) is
usually well below 103 in the GHz-regime and decreases
with ω.
A fit of the Drude model including background conductivity is shown in Fig. 2. At low frequencies the value
of σ ′ is not accurate and the experimental error of ǫ′ in
the 10 GHz-range is considerable. Although discrepancies in the shape of the frequency dependencies remain,
the principal characteristics as described above can be reproduced. The observed more stretched frequency dependence is expected for a distribution of τ and ωp . Given
the experimental inaccuracies, the order of magnitude of
the fit parameters is correct. The scattering time is estimated as τ = 2 − 5 × 10−12 s, the plasma frequency as
ωp = 2.5−5.5×1013 s−1 and the background conductivity
as σb = 2 − 3 × 104 S/m.

The transition temperature T ∗ for the uncleaned sample
is higher than for the cleaned one. Also, dσdc /dT below
T ∗ is larger for the latter. Both indicate that inter-rope
barriers limit σdc at low temperatures. These findings
are consistent with the higher σdc , lower T ∗ and weaker
dσdc /dT below T ∗ [3] of single rope data, where interrope barriers are eliminated.
Highly conducting polymers like doped polyaniline
(PAN) and polypyrrole (PPy) [29,30] and SWNT-mats
show analogous dielectric behavior. In the metallic polymers σdc typically has a maximum value of order 104 S/m
(around 200 K) and decreases to lower temperatures.
The values of ǫ′ (ω) are strongly frequency and T dependent. Let us take one of the best conducting materials,
PAN doped with d,1-camphorsulfonic acid (PAN-CSA),
as an example [30]. Around 1 meV (ω ∼ 1.5 THz) at 200
K ǫ′ (ω) is a few times −103 , and becomes less negative
at lower T . For the same samples at room temperature
ǫ′ (ω) starts negative, becomes positive around 30 meV,
returns negative around 0.1 eV and finally comes close to
zero in the optical regime. In the SWNT-mats the maximum value of σdc is almost 105 S/m, and ǫ(285 GHz)
reaches a value of −103 and decreases in absolute value
with decreasing temperature (by a factor of two at 4.2 K).
At room temperature below 0.5 meV ǫ′ (ω) is negative,
likely becomes positive at higher energies and returns
negative again around 10 meV [18,31,10]. The comparison shows that best conducting polymers are essentially
behaving like well-rinsed mats of single wall nanotubes
(the same similarity exists between not-rinsed mats and
the slightly less conducting polymers). Like in the mats,
in these polymers values for Λ will be of the order of 100
nm for vF = 5 × 105 m/s [30]. In the metallic polymers
homogeneous and inhomogeneous disorder models [30,10]
are frequently used to explain these extreme values. For
the nanotubes crystalline regions are excluded (TEM pictures show the nanotube mats to be completely entangled and disordered), which at least for the SWNT-mats
requires an alternative for the inhomogeneous disorder
model.
In summary, we have shown that the delocalized properties of nanotube mats can be completely determined
by sub-THz measurements and are well described in a
Drude picture with a negligible temperature dependence
of the plasma frequency and scattering time. The values of ωp and τ resemble those found in well conducting
doped polymers. When modeled with the usually chosen Fermi velocities, unusually large values of the mean
free path result for both systems. This finding and the
absence of crystalline regions in the mats underline the
need for a better description of these disordered strandlike systems.
