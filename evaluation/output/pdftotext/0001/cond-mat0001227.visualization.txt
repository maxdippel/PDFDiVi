Introduction

The problem of determining the asymptotic behaviour of a conformal field theory (CFT) under the action of a relevant operator is well studied and understood, [38;5;1m1[0m

[38;5;1m==[0m also in view of its relation to the physics of many quantum one-dimensional (1D) and classical two-dimensional (2D) models. A less studied case concerns a CFT perturbed by two relevant operators. Namely, consider a CFT subjected to such relevant perturbation, [90m[[0m[38;5;1mgO∆g[0m[90m/[0m[38;5;22mgOΔg,[0m[90m][0m with scaling dimension [90m[[0m[38;5;1m∆g[0m[90m/[0m[38;5;22mΔg[0m[90m][0m 2, that turns it into a fully massive quantum field theory (QFT)Then add another relevant perturbation, [90m[[0m[38;5;1mλO∆λ[0m[90m/[0m[38;5;22mλOΔλ,[0m[90m][0m which, if acting alone, would also make our QFT fully massive. Although this is not as common situation as the previous one, we will show that it displays interesting features which may be realized in physical systems.

[38;5;1m‖[0m Without loss of generality, we assume that [90m[[0m[38;5;1m∆λ ∆g[0m[90m/[0m[38;5;22mΔλ Δg[0m[90m][0m 2, i.e. that the second perturbation is more relevant then the first one. Moreover, we shall require, for the time being, that the operator product expansion (OPE) of these two operators is closed in the sense that it does not produce other relevant operators. The most general case will be discussed in a separate section. Then, the naïve expectation, which prevailed until recently, is that no qualitative changes occur in this case with respect to the standard situation of a CFT perturbed by a single relevant operator: the low-energy behaviour of the theory would be governed by the most relevant operator and, at any rate, the theory would remain fully massive. This expectation is however not a general rule if the two operators exclude each other, that is, if the field configurations which minimise one perturbation term do not minimise the other. In this case, the interplay between the two competing relevant operators can produce a novel quantum phase transition between two massive QFT's through a critical (massless) point. It is intuitively clear that such a scenario is only conceivable if the ratio of the bare coupling constants, |g λ|is large enough.

The purpose of this paper is to investigate in detail the critical properties of this transition and to discuss physical applications to spin chains and other quantum one-dimensional (1D) systems. While we shall concentrate on the DSG model in what follows, it should be noted that the phenomenon is more general similar quantum phase transitions do happen in more complicated models; those shall be addressed elsewhere [90m[\cite=else].[0m

[38;5;1m‖[0m Apart from the practical interest in physical realizations of the DSG model, this problem is of relevance also from a pure theoretical point of view. Indeed, we have already mentioned that the Ising critical point separates two strong-coupling, massive phases; hence, by definition, its analytical description is outside the range of applicability of perturbation theory. In this paper we propose a nonperturbative scheme, which is essentially based on the mapping of the DSG model onto another equivalent model a generalised quantum Ashkin-Teller model on a 1D lattice, where the Ising critical point becomes accessible.

[38;5;1m‖[0m The paper is organised as follows. In section 2 we briefly discuss the DSG model at the semi-classical level and outline our approach to tackle the Ising criticality in the vicinity of the decoupling point [90m[[0m[38;5;1mβ 2[0m[90m/[0m[38;5;22mβ2[0m[90m][0m 4π. In sections 3-5 we present a complete description of the critical properties of the DSG model at the Ising transition. In section 3 we introduce a quantum lattice version of a generalised AT model which, apart from the conventional marginal inter-chain coupling, also includes a 'magnetic filed' type of interaction, [90m[[0m[38;5;1mhσ1 σ2[0m[90m/[0m[38;5;22mhσ1σ2.[0m[90m][0m We show that, in the continuum limit, this model is equivalent to the DSG model at [90m[[0m[38;5;1mβ 2[0m[90m/[0m[38;5;22mβ2[0m[90m][0m 4π. In section 4 we employ a new (σ-τ) representation of the deformed AT model which enables us to correctly identify those degrees of freedom that become [38;5;1m==[0m critical. In section 5 we use the results of the quantum-spin-chain mappings to determine the physical properties of the DSG model close to the criticality.

[38;5;1m‖[0m In the next two sections we discuss applications of the DSG model to physical systems. In particular, we discuss Ising transitions in a spontaneously dimerized S=1/2 antiferromagnetic chain in a staggered magnetic field (section 6)and in the 1D Hubbard model with a staggered potential (section 7)In section 8 we show that at [90m[[0m[38;5;1mβ 2[0m[90m/[0m[38;5;22mβ2[0m[90m][0m 2π the second-order Ising transition may transform to a [90m[[0m[38;5;1mfirstorder[0m[90m/[0m[38;5;22mfirst-order[0m[90m][0m one.

The model and its quasi-classical analysis

In this paper we will be dealing with the particular version of the DSG model [90m([\ref=HDSG])[0m corresponding to the case g 0. We will also assume that λ 0, although its sign is unimportant due to the obvious symmetry Φ Φ.

For 2π [90m[[0m[38;5;1mβ 2[0m[90m/[0m[38;5;22mβ2[0m[90m][0m 8π the Gaussian model is perturbed by two relevant vertex [38;5;1m==[0m operators closed under the OPE [90m[\cite=DM].[0m The existence of the Ising phase transition can be qualitatively understood via a quasi-classical analysis: inspecting the profile of the potential U(Φ) as a function of the ratio x λ 4g. At x 0 one has a [38;5;1m==[0m periodic potential of a single-frequency sine-Gordon (SG) model. For x [38;5;1m6=[0m 0 the [38;5;1m==[0m period of the potential is doubled in such a way that in the region 0 x 1 it can be viewed as a sequence of double-well potentials with the local structure [38;5;1m==[0m AΦ2 BΦ4, where A 0,B 0. Precisely at x 1 each local double-well potential transforms to a Φ4 one (A 0)and (in the Ginzburg-Landau sense) this is a signature of the Ising criticality with the central charge c 1 2. It should be stressed that the double-well structure of the potential U(Φ) only occurs for g 0. Hence the Ising critical point only exist for positive g. The case of g 0 is qualitatively different: here the λ-perturbation removes the degeneracy between neighbouring minima of cos βΦ and thus leads to soliton confinement (similarly to the analysis in Ref [90m[\cite=aff-conf]).[0mThe spectrum in this case always remains massive.

[38;5;1m‖[0m Thus, for model [90m([\ref=HDSG])[0m with g 0, a plausible scenario is that the relevant perturbations naturally act on the two constituent Ising models of the starting Gaussian model, leaving one of them massless on the critical line λ λc(g)[90m[[0m[38;5;1m(Quasiclassically[0m[90m/[0m[38;5;22m(Quasi-classically[0m[90m][0m λc(g) 4g.

Namely, it is well known [90m[\cite=Coleman][\cite=LE] that β2[0m 4π is the decoupling (or Luther-Emery) point of the ordinary SG model (λ 0)at which the latter is equivalent to a theory of free massive fermions. The scaling dimension 1/4 of the λ-term in [90m([\ref=HDSG])[0m indicates that this point is special for the DSG model as well, suggesting an Ising model interpretation. In this paper we shall be working in the vicinity of the decoupling point. Rescaling the field Φ, the DSG model can be written in an [38;5;1m4[0m

This argument can be extended to finite values of λ, provided that the two Ising copies are originally in a disordered phase, and thus explains the existence of a critical line in the t-λ plane (t (T Tc) Tc 0) [38;5;1m==[0m along which the deformed AT model flows from the ultraviolet c 1 fixed point to the infrared c 1 2 Ising fixed point.

[38;5;1m‖[0m We shall elaborate on the DM argument by explicitly constructing the mappings between the DSG model and various spin models, with the aim to fully describe the Ising transition and, in particular, calculate correlation functions of the operators in the original DSG model. The novel points of our analysis are as follows. First, we concentrate on quantum lattice spin chain models rather than on their classical counterparts (in the transfer matrix sense)as this formulation profits from the use of the powerful apparatus of various spin operator transformations like the duality transformation. Secondly, we identify the correct degrees of freedom in the deformed quantum AT model that become critical. Since the original Ising models enter symmetrically, this is a nontrivial step which is accomplished via a 'change of basis' transformation. Let us denote the critical degrees of freedom by σ and the remaining gaped degrees of freedom by τ (see the main text for precise definitions)The strategy to calculate the correlation functions is then to express the DSG-operators in terms of the lattice σ and τ operators. At the Ising transition σ and τ operators asymptotically decouple, with the [90m[[0m[38;5;1mσoperators[0m[90m/[0m[38;5;22mσ-operators[0m[90m][0m being critical and (some of) the τ operators acquiring finite average values. This allows us to trace the relation between the original DSG-operators and those from the operator content of the underlying critical Ising model, which ultimately accomplishes a complete description of the critical properties at the Ising transition.

In such situations, the Hamiltonians H±when [38;5;1m==[0m considered separately, describe only excitations above each of the two degenerate vacua.

[38;5;1m‖[0m Thus, when working with a single Hamiltonian H+all operators representing [38;5;1m==[0m strongly fluctuating fields at the Ising critical point are automatically taken into account.

[38;5;1m‖[0m The capability of an apparently subleading operator to change a continuous transition to a first order one is indeed common to a variety of models. For instance, it is known that the critical line with non universal exponents separating the Charge Density Wave (CDW) and the Spin Density Wave (SDW) phases of the extended (U-V) Hubbard model, becomes a first order line at sufficiently strong coupling [90m[\cite=Hirsh].[0mIn fact, in the extended Hubbard model, the charge Luttinger liquid exponent Kc can be lower than 1 2, the point at which the second harmonics of the Umklapp scattering starts to be relevant. Therefore, at sufficiently strong interaction, it can indeed turn the CDW-SDW transition line into a first order one. A similar situation occurs with the charge transition in the electronic model, considered in section 7, when the latter is generalised to include a sufficiently strong nearest-neighbour repulsion [90m[\cite=nagaosa].[0m

Conclusions

In this paper, we have proposed a nonperturbative description of the Ising criticality in the DSG model [90m([\ref=HDSG]).[0m Using the equivalence between the DSG model and a deformed quantum Ashkin-Teller model, valid in the vicinity of the decoupling point, [90m[[0m[38;5;1mβ 2[0m[90m/[0m[38;5;22mβ2[0m[90m][0m 4π, we were able to identify the effective Ising degrees of freedom that asymptotically decouple from the rest of the spectrum and become critical in the infrared limit. This identification allowed us to describe the UV-IR "transmutation" of all physical fields of the DSG model and calculate the correlation functions at and close to the transition. We have also demonstrated the efficiency of our approach to describe Ising transitions in some physical realizations of the DSG model.

[38;5;1m‖[0m We believe that our quantum-Ising-chain approach can be generalised to the case when the number of the constituent Ising models, coupled by the interaction [90m[formula],[0m [48;5;167mQ[0m

In such systems, the quantum critical points may be not only of the Ising type but also correspond to SU(2)k WZNW universality class. Such examples will be considered elsewhere [90m[\cite={else}].[0m

The restriction [90m([\ref=restr-ising])[0m tells us that, for the Ising criticality to be reached at some critical value of h, the original disordered σ1 and σ2 chains should be far enough from their original critical point. In fact, as follows from [90m([\ref=restr-ising]),[0m the value of the Majorana mass, when estimated as m 2([38;5;22mΔ[0m J) 4J π, turns out to be of the order of the ultraviolet cutoff.
