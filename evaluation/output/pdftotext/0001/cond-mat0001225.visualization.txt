[48;5;167mI. INTRODUCTION[0m

[38;5;1mII.[0m Experimental results

As found earlier [90m[\cite=Venema][0m individual carbon nanotubes can be locally cut by applying a voltage pulse to the tip of a scanning tunneling microscope (STM)The carbon nanotubes that were studied were single-walled, synthesized by a laser vaporization technique and consisted mainly of 1.4 nm diameter nanotubes (material from R.E. Smalley and coworkers) [90m[\cite=Smalley].[0mSamples were prepared by depositing a dispersion of nanotubes in 1,2-dichloroethane onto single-crystal Au(111) surfaces. The experiments were done both at room temperature and at 4 K.

[38;5;1mâ€–[0m Nanotubes are cut by the following procedure: During imaging of a nanotube in constant-current mode, scanning is interrupted and the STM tip moves to a selected position on the nanotube. Feedback is then switched off and a voltage pulse between tip and sample is applied for 1 ms. After this pulse, the feedback is switched on again and scanning resumes where imaging was interrupted. The distance between the STM tip and the nanotube during a pulse is determined by the settings for the feedback current and voltage. Fig. 1(b) shows an example of a nanotube that has been cut into various smaller tube pieces as a result of voltage pulses of -3.75 V applied at the positions marked in Fig. 1(a)Often, tube parts beneath the STM tip are picked up during a pulse. This usually leads to degradation of the tip quality. Cleaning of the tip can then be done by applying voltages on the gold surface, away from the nanotube.

[38;5;1m1[0m

The cutting efficiency as a function of the bias voltage applied during a pulse is shown in Fig. 2. This experimental result provides essential input for the theoretical modeling of the cutting mechanism described below. The efficiency at a specific voltage is defined as the number of successful cutting events divided by the total number of applied pulses at that voltage. A large number (about 150) of voltage pulses were applied at room temperature in a range of 1 to 6 V, at positive and negative polarity. The pulses were applied on various nanotubes, both semiconducting and metallic. To study the dependence of cutting efficiency on the distance between the STM tip and the nanotube during a pulse, feedback currents were varied between 20 pA and 1 nA and feedback voltages between 0.1 and 3 V were used. No dependence of cutting efficiency on the tunnel distance was found. Pulses applied with various feedback currents and voltages are therefore included in same graph of Fig. 2. The main experimental results are listed below:

[38;5;1mIII.[0m [38;5;1m1.[0m We find a sharp threshold for the voltage of 3.8 0.2 V for cutting nanotubes. This is independent of polarity. Below 3.6 V, nanotubes could almost never be cut. Above 4 V, tubes were almost always cut.

[38;5;1m2.[0m The cutting efficiency is independent of the feedback tunnel current or voltage. The tunnel resistance has been varied over three orders of magnitude, which changes the tunnel distance significantly. This demonstrates that the determining physical quantity for cutting is the voltage, rather than the electric field.

[38;5;1mâ€–[0m The cutting procedure appears to be effective for different types of nanotubes. We observe no dependence on the electronic character (i.e. semiconducting or metallic) of a tube.

[38;5;1m3.[0m Nanotubes can be cut at room temperature as well as at 4 K.

[38;5;1mâ€–[0m Nanotubes within bundles can be cut as efficiently as isolated single-wall tubes (see for an example Fig. 3)[38;5;1mâ€–[0m Upon decreasing the tunnel distance considerably by increasing the tunnel current beyond 1 nA, nanotubes are moved away laterally by the STM tip during imaging.

[38;5;1mâ€–[0m The separation between nanotube ends created by a cut varies significantly in size, from a few nm to 20 nm. Sometimes, the tube ends are displaced after the cut. Fig. 4(a) for example shows a strongly bent nanotube on which two voltage pulses were applied near the marked positions. Fig. 4(b) shows that the three tube parts separated by the cuts were moved significantly by the cutting events. Most likely, the nanotube was fixed on the substrate under some strain that was released by the cutting.

However, experimentally we find that the tubes are moved laterally when the tip is brought close to the tube. This is related to the large reversible elastic response (flexibility) exhibited by carbon nanotubes [90m[\cite=falvo98].[0m[48;5;110m Simulations of C60-molecules impact on carbon nanotubes have shown that even large radial forces produce reversible elastic distortions indicating that crashing the tip onto the tube is not an efficient method to cut [90m[\cite=ar1].[0m[48;5;110mFurthermore, there is no obvious energy scale of [38;5;1m4[0m[48;5;110m  [38;5;1mâ€–[0m[48;5;110m[0m [38;5;1m2[0m

[48;5;110m[38;5;1mâ€–[0m[48;5;110m Collective excitations (plasmons)Plasmons excited by inelastic electron scattering of the tunneling current can decay into electron-hole pairs, phonons or other excitations that induce a polarization or charge separation in the tube. Eventually the release of the plasmon energy leads to a break through local heating and atom evaporation. Due to the particular cylindrical geometry of carbon nanotubes we expect to have a Ï€-plasmon excitation at about 5 eV [90m[\cite=plasmon].[0m[48;5;110m This has been confirmed experimentally [90m[\cite=Pichler][0m[48;5;110m for SWNTs of 1.4 nm diameter. The decay of the plasmon excitation into atom evaporation is a well-known phenomenon in metallic clusters where the surface-plasmon energy is of the order of the binding energy leading to atom-evaporation as an effective decaying mechanism of the collective excitations [90m[\cite=Heer].[0m[48;5;110m In the case of tubes with an internal binding energy greater than 7 eV/atom (as for most carbon solids; see Table I)however, multiple-plasmon excitations need to be active to induce transitions which weaken the carbon bonds. This puts this mechanism behind first-order models. However, it can enhance the probability of electronic excitations (see below)[0mLocalized particle-hole excitations; This mechanism is concerned with the symmetry-allowed interband excitation of localized Ïƒ-states to states of Ï€* character near the Fermi level. These electronic excitations leave localized Ïƒ-holes behind which weaken the C-C bonds by creating possible nucleation sites for breaking of the tube. Electrons tunneling inelastically between tip and tube are the source for these excitations. The probability for this process is favored by the local electric field at the [90m[[0m[38;5;1mtiptube[0m[90m/[0m[38;5;22mtip-tube[0m[90m][0m interface, which, independent of the metallic or semiconducting behavior, enhances the number of possible bonding/antibonding transitions triggering the bond-breaking. The density of states (DOS) for a (10,10) nanotube, which is metallic, is shown in Fig. 5. Near the Fermi level, the DOS is finite and constant. At higher energies, sharp peaks can be observed which are the Van Hove singularities at the subband onsets [90m[\cite=stm_apa].[0m At above/below 3.6 eV from the Fermi level the interband excitations involve states with a predominant [90m[formula]/Ïƒ-localized[0m character with a small curvature induced Ïƒ Ï€/ [90m[formula][0mhybridization.

[38;5;1mIV.[0m The cutting mechanism

In the previous section we have sorted out a possible scenario for the cutting of nanotubes by a voltage pulse. This section discusses in more detail the bond weakening due to mechanisms 4 and 5 described in the previous section. The formation and propagation of topological defects due to the bond weakening will also be discussed.

[38;5;1mA.[0m Localized electronic excitation

In order to understand the role of electronic excitations in the bond-weakening [90m[\cite=dimer][0mand cutting process we show in Fig. 5 how the density of states of a (10,10) SWNT is modified by an applied electric field in the direction perpendicular to the tube axis. Here the structural relaxation and electronic calculations were done in the framework of the ab-initio total-energy [90m[[0m[38;5;1mdensityfunctional[0m[90m/[0m[38;5;22mdensity-functional[0m[90m][0m pseudopotential theory [90m[\cite=ar3].[0m We find that the field tends to increase the nanotube's lattice parameter by a few nearly independent of the polarity of the applied bias potential. Eventually, as the field strength increases, the structure can reach a state which is not in a stable equilibrium for the carbon atoms any more [90m[\cite=Tomanek].[0m

[38;5;1mâ€–[0m In the calculations shown in Fig. 5 the field acts on the whole tube for fixed atomic coordinates. Results are shown corresponding to electric fields accessible in the experimental setup (up to 1 eV/Ã…)One could also take into account the spatial variation of the applied field related to the tip-size. In that case there are distinct regions: one far from the tip where the electronic properties of the tube are dictated by the isolated tube and the other just beneath the tip where the electronic properties are modified by the applied field. From Fig. 5 we see that the applied field results in the appearance of localized levels which increases the DOS in an energy region close to the Fermi level (this effect is related to the bond-weakening and bond-length increase in carbon nanotubes under an applied voltage discussed above)The increase of density of states near the Fermi level enhances the number of possible transitions that can take place. Semiconducting nanotubes have a DOS comparable to that of metallic nanotubes, but have an energy gap with zero DOS near the Fermi energy. However, the electric field will induce states within the gap, similar to the increase of DOS near the Fermi level for metallic nanotubes. This allows localized particle-hole excitations to take place also for semiconducting nanotubes. Indeed, in the experiments [38;5;1m5.[0m [38;5;1m==[0m no difference is found in cutting efficiency between semiconducting and metallic nanotubes.

[38;5;1mâ€–[0m It may appear that any electronic mechanism should be current dependent. However the number of broken bonds is far less than the number of available electrons in the cutting process. The excitations become possible because of the large current available in the STM experiment. The experimental range of currents during the cutting process (more than 50 nA) is such that during the 1 ms pulse more than thousand electrons are involved in inelastic events. This means that we are in a saturated regime where cutting can in principle be achieved independent of the current. This situation can be compared to the situation of cutting Si:H bonds with an STM, where the desorption yield was found to be independent of bias or current once the bias is large enough [90m[\cite=petern].[0m The formation of topological defects is a natural way of releasing the excitation energy and naturally triggers the breaking process.

[38;5;1mB.[0m Field-induced elastic deformation

We study the tip-field induced mechanical stress in the nanotube within a macroscopical approach. An argument for using a macroscopic model is that the specific elastic constants of single wall nanotubes determined from experiments follow quite well the predictions for the macroscopic elasticity theory (in terms of the Young's modulus, Poisson ratio and torsion and bending elastic constants [90m[\cite=Hernandez]).[0m Although the ultimate description of the fracture mechanics is a complex phenomenon that requires both macroscopic and microscopic descriptions, we thus rely on a continuous model to get a first estimate of the parameters involved in the process. The typical energy of the distortion process is such that it corresponds to bond-breaking energies for carbon compounds (see Table I) or to displacements which fulfill a Lindeman melting criterion [90m[\cite=Lindemann][0m of a 10% change in bond distance.

[48;5;110mNow we address how the electronically and mechanically induced strain can lead to the breakdown of a tube. A plausible mechanism is the Stone-Wales (SW) transformation leading to bond-rotation defects [90m[\cite=SW].[0m[48;5;110mThis comprises of a pair of pentagon-heptagon defects obtained by a simple C-C bond-rotation in the hexagonal network, see Fig. 6.

[48;5;110m[38;5;1mâ€–[0m[48;5;110m We have performed molecular dynamics simulations of strain-induced defect and plastic/brittle behavior using the tight binding parameterization of Ref. [90m[\cite=tbmd][0m[48;5;110m that reproduces quite well density-functional calculations within the local-density-approximation [90m[\cite=md].[0m[48;5;110mThe computed (T=0K) SW defect formation energy in an armchair nanotube at different applied strains shows that for a tensile strain of about 5% for a (10,10) tube and 12% for a (12,0) tube, the defect geometry is energetically favourable over[0m [38;5;1m==[0m the perfect tube [90m[\cite=defect_paul].[0mThe activation barrier for the formation of defects is lowered by the applied tension. Indeed the activation barrier for bond rotation in a (10,10) nanotube is found to reduce from 5.6 eV at zero strain to 3 eV at 10% strain; similar reduction is observed for the barrier for separation of the pentagon-heptagon dislocation cores. The dynamics of these defects are dictated by the tube chirality as well as the applied tension and temperature. In particular at high applied strain and low temperature all tubes are brittle [90m[\cite=Marco].[0m In the simulations restricted to armchair tubes, we observed that after the nucleation of the first SW-defect, octagonal and higher order rings start to appear as the applied strain is increased. This leads to brittle behavior and shows the important role of the strain induced by the applied voltage. The simulation time scale for the formation and evolution of these defects are of the order of nanoseconds, much shorter than the applied voltage pulse of 1 ms. We thus expect the natural nucleation and evolution of these defects beneath the tip region of the STM, leading to a bond breaking and possible local collapse of the structure.

[38;5;1mV.[0m Conclusions and Outlook

From the previous discussion we conclude that the applied voltage at the STM tip creates: (i) excitation of localized Ïƒ-bonding states, (ii) a change in the density of states around the Fermi level making the tubes more metallic-like and, (iii) an overall distortion of the region beneath the tip, leading to the formation and evolution of strain-induced topological defects. These processes together are responsible for the cutting mechanism with the threshold voltage of 4 V. The proposed mechanism relies only on the applied voltage. It appears that within the experimental values, the tip-tube distance does not change the results.

[38;5;1mâ€–[0m It would be interesting to attempt the cutting in [90m[[0m[38;5;1mmultiwalled[0m[90m/[0m[38;5;22mmulti-walled[0m[90m][0m carbon nanotubes also. The cutting will probably not work for these nanotubes since the inner layers are able to accomodate the stress acting on the outer layers. Furthermore we expect the inter-tube van der Waals interaction in multi-walled nanotubes to be strong enough to partially release the concentration of elastic strain so that only atoms of the outer surface will be affected. This is different to the case of nanotubes in bundles, where the cutting process is as effective as for isolated nanotubes (see Fig. 3)In this case the other tubes in the bundle act as a global support similar to the gold substrate for the isolated SWNTs.

[38;5;1mâ€–[0m It may be interesting to see if the breaking process is accompanied by photon emission to any significant degree to gain further information about the energetic of the possible processes. Photon emission provides a signal that is dependent on the local physical environment beneath the tip with a spatial resolution determined by [48;5;167m[1] S. Iijima, Nature 354, 56 (1991)P.M.
