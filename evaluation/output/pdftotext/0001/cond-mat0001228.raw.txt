An effective-medium theory is proposed for random weakly nonlinear dielectric media. It is
based on a new gaussian approximation for the probability distributions of the electric field in each
component of a multi-phase composite. These distributions are computed to linear order from a
Bruggeman-like self-consistent formula. The resulting effective-medium formula for the nonlinear
medium reduces to Bruggeman’s in the linear case. It is exact up to second order in a weakdisorder expansion, and close to the exact result in the dilute limit (in particular, it is exact for
d = 1 and d = ∞). In a high contrast situation, the noise exponents are κ = κ′ = 0 near the
percolation threshold. Numerical results are provided for different weak nonlinearities. The use of
the Bruggeman formula as a starting point for nonlinear homogeneization theories in dimensions
d > 2 is questioned on the basis of known exact bounds on the noise exponents.

I. INTRODUCTION

Numerous papers have been devoted to the problem of determining the effective constitutive law of random nonlinear
composites in electrostatics1–16 , of importance for understanding various nonlinear phenomena, either entering the
class of “weakly nonlinear” (WNL) phenomena, or that of “strongly nonlinear” phenomena such as random fuse-type
or dielectric breakdown-type failure of materials17 .
A convenient approach to the homogeneization problem is the “energetic” one20,21 , which can be summarized as
follows. Let wx (E) be the local potential (the energy density) from which derives the local nonlinear constitutive law.
The homogeneization step consists in computing the effective potential W as the volume average
W = hwx (E)i,

(1)

from which the effective constitutive law can be deduced (see below). Denoting by pα the volume proportion of
component (“phase”) α in a composite medium where wx = wα if x is in phase α, and introducing the volume
averages per phase h·iα , W can be written
X
W =
pα hwα (E)iα .
(2)
α

A class of effective-medium theories, mostly concerned with weak power-law nonlinearities, use our ability to
compute the second moment of the electric field E in the various phases of the composite18 , completed by a decoupling
approximation3,19

hwα (E)iα ≃ wα hE 2 i1/2
.
(3)
α

This approximation is exact only when wα is quadratic (the linear theory), or when the field is uniform, which occurs
only if all the wα are equal, i.e. in a homogeneous medium.
The purpose of this paper is to present a means to overcome this approximation, starting from the following remark:
actually, with an additional hypothesis of ergodicity per phase, a volume phase average can be reinterpreted as an
average over some probability distribution for the electric field in the phase under consideration. In this paper, volume
averages will henceforth be identified to statistical averages. Then, the problem of computing W , Equ. (2), reduces

to computing the probability distribution Pα of the field in each phase, by means of which the phase averages h·iα
can be carried out, without appealing to (3).
Note that the full probability distribution P(E) of the electric field in the medium is then
X
P(E) =
pα Pα (E).

α

Thus, the probability distributions of the field per phase are functions of great importance, since they carry all the
information needed to build up the effective nonlinear properties. A few analyses of P(E) are available22 , mainly
focused on its tail of relevance for breakdown phenomena23 . However, up to my knowledge, none has been specifically
aimed at the individual components Pα (E). Chen and Sheng studied numerically the distribution of the local field
in binary composites24 . An analytical model of the same distribution was subsequently proposed by Barthélémy and
Orland, with excellent agreement with the latter simulations22 . Both works were limited to linear composites, in
a weak-contrast situation. A first numerical attempt in the continuum, in a strong-contrast situation this time, is
due to Cheng and Torquato25 . They carried out two-dimensional numerical calculations on disordered systems with
inclusions of various shapes. An exact calculation for P in a linear medium with Hashin-Shtrikman (HS) geometry
was recently made using a density of states approach26. In these works, the distribution P was found to be essentially
bimodal for a binary medium (save in the HS geometry where fine-structure peaks are not wiped out by positional
disorder), especially at high dielectric contrast25 . This is understandable in wiew of the decomposition (4).
Still, in parallel with the second moment of the field, the first moment in each phase (the average field) can be
computed as well from any linear effective-medium theory, without requiring any a priori knowledge about Pα . Widely
used in mechanics of random continuous media in the framework of the so-called “thermoelastic problem”27 , this fact
seems to have escaped most of the litterature on random dielectric media, excepted in the work by Ponte Castañeda
and Kailasam15 where it is used to compute reference fields around which non-linear potentials are expanded prior to
homogeneization. Knowing the first two moments is enough to attempt a modelization of Pα . The proposal examined
in the present paper is to approximate each Pα (E) by a gaussian vector distribution, and thereby, to estimate (2) for
any potential, without appealing to the strong (and somewhat artificial) decoupling assumption (3).
The scope of the paper is limited however to WNL media, for which it is sufficient to compute the field distribution
to linear order only1,2 . An extension of these considerations to strongly nonlinear media will be examined elsewhere.
II. GENERAL FRAMEWORK

Let us therefore consider a d-dimensional random medium described by WNL thermodynamic potentials of the
type
wx (E) = wxlin (E) + wxnl (E),

(5)

where
wxlin (E) =

1 2
εE
2

(6)

(ε(x) being the local permittivity entering the linear part), and wxnl (E) is the nonlinear (i.e. non-quadratic) part of
the potential, assumed to be small. The local constitutive law is
Di =

∂wx (E)
.
∂Ei

(7)

The potential is prescribed in each phase: wx (E) = wα (E) if x ∈ α. Under the ergodic hypothesis introduced
above, and a “boundary” condition28 hEi = E0 , the effective potential reads
W (E 0 ) = Wlin (E 0 ) + Wnl (E 0 ),

(8)

where

Wnl (E 0 ) =

(10)

The effective constitutive law in the homgeneized medium is then
∂W (E 0 )
.
∂Ei0

Di0 =

(11)

To first order in wxnl , the field distributions entering (9) and (10) need only be computed at the linear level1,2 . The
procedure is the following one. An extended linear anisotropic homogeneization problem is first considered, with an
artificial ferroelectric-like part added to the potential15 :
w̃xlin (E) =

1
Ei εij Ej + Pi Ei ,
2

(12)

α
where εij (x) = εα
ij and Pi (x) = Pi if x ∈ α. The corresponding local constitutive law is Di = εij Ej + Pi . Assuming
one knows an estimate for

W̃lin (E 0 ) = hw̃xlin (E)i,

(13)

(cf. below), the following exact relations hold for the distribution Pα of the original linear problem (9):

(15)

Both (14a) and (14b) are particular cases of a more general theorem, the demonstration of which can be found in
appendix B of the review by Ponte Castañeda and Suquet on nonlinear composites29 . This theorem is a consequence
of the equality hDi Ei i = hDi ihEi i which holds only for particular boundary conditions, or in the infinite-volume limit
if there exists an effective permittivity.
Let us set
Miα = hEi iα ,

of the macroscopic field. I introduce now the gaussian approximation for the probability distributions Pα

which constitutes the main ingredient of the theory.
There remains to compute an approximation for the quantities hEi iα and hEi Ej iα , in oprder to completely define
the above gaussian distributions. Let us therefore estimate W̃lin (E 0 ) through an extension of the Bruggeman selfconsistent effective-medium approximation30 to potentials of the form (12). The formula is given and discussed in
Appendix A. Using the scalar permittivities and Pi = 0, this estimate reduces to
Wlin (E 0 ) =

1

ε0 E 0 ,
2

(19)

where ε0 is the usual Bruggeman effective permittivity30 . In addition, the derivatives (14a) and (14b) of the estimate
for W̃lin (E 0 ) yield

Note that the Bruggeman equation for ε0 reads hµi = 1, or alternatively hµεi = hµiε0 = ε0 . From these relations,

we check that: (i) hεEi = ε0 hEi; (ii) hεE 2 i = ε0 hEi2 , where hEi = E 0 , as must be. Expressions for Ckα and C⊥
are
readily obtained from (21).
In Fig. 1 are displayed curves for the probability density Pk (Ek /E 0 ) of the normalized longitudinal electric field,
Ek = E · Ê0 , for a binary medium with dielectric ratio ε2 /ε1 = 5, for various fractions p2 of material 2. The space
dimension is d = 2. With P(E) given by (4), and E written as E = Ek Ê0 + E⊥ (which defines E⊥ ), Pk is obtained as

where E⊥ is the transverse component of the field: E⊥ = E− Ek . The probability density tends towards a Dirac peak,
centered at Ek /E 0 = 1 as p2 → 0 or p2 → 1, since the field is then equal to the applied field E0 . For intermediate
volume fractions, the bimodal character of the probability distribution is evident.
Under the same conditions, Fig. 2 displays the probability density of the scaled modulus of the transverse electric
field, E⊥ /E 0 . This distribution is defined, for E⊥ > 0, by

where Sd = 2π d/2 /Γ(d/2) is the surface of a d-dimensional unit sphere. Unlike the previous one, this distribution
is not multimodal since the mean value of the transverse field is hE⊥ iα = 0 in each phase, whatever the volume
fractions.
Fig. 3 displays Pk (Ek /E 0 ) for a higher dielectric ratio ε2 /ε1 = 1000. The concentrations are p2 = 0.12, 0.24, 0.36.
These plots can be compared to that obtained from hard disks simulations by Cheng and Torquato (CT) in Fig. 3 of
Ref.25 , for the same dielectric contrast and concentrations p2 = 0.2, 0.4, 0.6. These concentrations differ from ours
by a factor 0.6. Apart from these differences, the overall features (shape and heights) of the probability distributions
are well rendered: a Dirac peak close to Ek = 0 indicates that the field is almost null in phase 2, and a widely
spread contribution from phase 1 for the highest p2 indicates an enhancement of the fluctuations in this phase as the
percolation threshold (for the Bruggeman theory), or the jamming threshold (for the CT simulations) is approached.
The differences in the values for p2 can be explained by the fact that the present theory relies on the Bruggeman
effective-medium formula, of relevance for cell-materials but not really adequate for hard disks. Moreover, the overall
agreement between our distributions and that of CT is not so good at moderate dielectric contrast: Bruggeman’s
theory completed by the gaussian approximation somewhat overestimates, because of its percolating nature, the
width of the probability distributions. Better adequation with the CT simulations would probably be obtained with
an effective-medium theory for dielectric-coated inclusions, which would prevent percolation. Since our main objective
however is to discuss an effective-medium therory for WNL composites, such an improvement will not be considered
here.
With these results in hand, analytical investigations of the theory can be carried out in some limiting cases, as well
as numerical ones in more complicated situations. The next section examines particular WNL potentials.

III. WEAKLY NONLINEAR POWER-LAW POTENTIAL

As a first application, a WNL local potential of the form
wx (E) =

1 2 1
εE + χE 4 + O(E 6 ),
2
4

(27)

is considered, where the E 4 term is the first in a series of corrections to the linear behaviour. The corresponding
constitutive law is
Di = [ε + χE 2 + O(E 4 )]Ei .

(28)

This approximation actually is a weak-field one.

The phase averages hE 4 iα are carried out with the help of Wick’s theorem which allows to write down expressions
for the integer moments of a centered vector gaussian distribution by mere inspection31 : with Ai = Ei − Miα ,
hAi Ai Aj Aj iα = hAi Ai iα hAj Aj iα + 2hAi Aj iα hAi Aj iα .

A few simplifications yield the simple result


χ0 = (1 + 2/d)y 2 + (2 − 2/d)z 2 − 2 hµ4 χi.

(32)

(33)

As a first check, we remark that in a non-disordered situation where ε and χ are constant in the medium, we have
ε0 = ε and µ = 1, so that y = z = 1; whence χ0 = χ, as was expected.
B. Weak-contrast expansion

A further check for the self-consistent formula (33) consists in examining its weak-contrast limit. An exact expression
is known for any nonlinear potential, which is first briefly reminded. In the weak-contrast expansion5,7,15,16 , the
local potentials wx (y) are assumed to fluctuate weakly around their mean value w(0) (y) = hwx (y)i. Introducing a
(1)
bookkeeping parameter t to be set to 1 in the final results, the contrast, wx (y), is defined by
wx (y) = w(0) (y) + wx(1) (y)t,

(34)

(1)

so that hwx (y)i = 0. An expansion for the effective potential is sought for in the form:
W (E 0 ) = W (0) + W (1) t + W (2) t2 + · · ·

(39)

This result is the exact one15 . An analogous expansion for the complementary potential W̃ (D0 ) defined from the dual
homogeneization problem can be written down15,16 .
Let us therefore set ε = hεi + δε t and χ = hχi + δχ t. The Bruggeman permittivity ε0 is exact to second order in

Hence, the gaussian decoupling which accounts for the vector character of the electric field, of importance in nonlinear
problems, is superior to the simple approximation hE 4 i ≃ hE 2 i2 .
C. Dilute limit

For a binary medium with two components of constitutive parameters (ε1 , χ1 ) and (ε2 , χ2 ), the dilute limit is the
limiting situation where the volume fraction p of (e.g.) component 2 is small. Setting

Compared to (46), expression (45) becomes exact when χ1 = 0 (nonlinear inclusion in a linear host). It also becomes
exact for d = 1, and in the limit d → ∞ where the field is E = E0 in each phase so that χ0 = hχi. Moreover, it is
exact up to order T 2 , which is consistent with its correct limiting weak-contrast behavior. For d = 2, it is exact up
to order T 3 . However, the term of order T 4 is wrong for 2 ≤ d < ∞. The reason for this misbehaviour is that the
dilute limit requires an exact computation of hE 4 iα (to linear order)4 , whereas we approximate it through a gaussian
average.
On the other hand, expression (42) yields


	
χ02 = χ1 + (χ2 − χ1 )(T − 1)4 + χ1 T 2 2(d + 2) − 4T + T 2 p + O(p2 ),
(47)

once again a result less precise than (45).
At the present time, since it requires an exact solution for the one-body problem, the test of the dilute limit appears
to be the most challenging one for nonlinear effective-medium theories.
This test is illustrated in Fig. 4 which displays χ0 , as calculated from (33) and (42), against the concentration p of
medium 2, for moderate dielectric contrast and d = 2. The thick line segments at p = 0, 1 represent exact tangents
obtained from (46). The tangent at p = 1 follows from substituting (1 − p) for p and interchanging the indices 1 and 2
in (46). Though not exact in the dilute limit, formula (33) yields tangents quite close to the exact ones. The marked
inaccuracy of formula (42) near p = 0 and p = 1 results in a lower value for χ0 in the whole concentration range.
D. Percolative behavior

Before examining the predictions of Equ. (33) near the percolation transition, I first briefly review the critical
behaviour of WNL composites, and discuss a flaw of the Bruggeman formula in this context.
An insulator/perfect conductor binary mixture undergoes a percolation transition for a critical metal fraction
p = pc 32 . For WNL phases, the critical behaviour of the field fluctuations is now well understood35 . In the limiting
situation where ε1 ≪ ε2 , and for p ≤ pc , one observes a behaviour
ε0 ∝ ε1 (p − pc )−s ,

′

χ0 ∝ χ1 (p − pc )−(2s+κ ) ;

(48)

χ0 ∝ χ2 (pc − p)(2t−κ) ,

(49)

on the contrary, for p > pc , one has
ε0 ∝ ε2 (pc − p)t ,

where s and t are the superconductivity and conductivity exponents, and where κ and κ′ are the noise exponents
which characterize an anomalous nonlinear susceptibility enhancement near the threshold34,35 . As a consequence of
the exact inequality hE 4 i ≥ hE 2 i2 , the exponents κ and κ′ are necessarily positive.
In the Bruggeman formula, pc = 1/d, and ε0 ≃ ε1 /(1−dp) for p < 1/d, ε0 ≃ ε2 (1−dp)/(1−d) for p > 1/d (ε1 ≪ ε2 ),
whence s = t = 1. Reporting these expressions into (33) yields κ = κ′ = 0, a result shared by all effective-medium
formulae based on (15).
These values can be compared to exact bounds obtained for κ and κ′ on the basis of the links-nodes-blob (LNB)
model for electric percolation, now commonly accepted as a model for e.g. random resistor networks (RRNs). These
are35
(3d − 4)ν − 2t + 1 ≤ κ ≤ 2(d − 1)ν − t,
(4 − d)ν − 2s + 1 ≤ κ′ ≤ 2ν − s,

(50a)
(50b)

(for d ≤ 6; the values for d > 6 are that of d = 6. Moreover t is not defined for d = 1), where ν is the correlation
length exponent: ξ ∝ |p − pc |−ν . Though the latter information is absent from the Bruggeman theory, an inequality
ν > 0 must hold in any situation relevant to percolating systems. In (50), the lower bounds must not be greater than
the upper ones, which leads to lower bounds for the exponents s and t themselves, namely
s ≥ (2 − d)ν + 1,
t ≥ (d − 2)ν + 1.

(51)
(52)

In the Bruggeman theory, s = t = 1 so that only ν = 0 – a problematic value by itself – is allowed, save for d = 2.
Reporting ν = 0 into (50) leads to κ = κ′ = −1, which is unacceptable. For d = 2, one obtains κ = κ′ = 2ν − 1.
Compared to the values κ = κ′ = 0 of the above effective-medium theory, this gives ν = 1/2, a non-conflicting value,
though lower than the exact result 4/3.
7

Of course, the fact that Bruggeman’s formula is a poor approximation near the percolation threshold is well-known.
However, this discussion enlightens a fundamental inconsistency in the Bruggeman exponent values which goes beyond
mere numerical inadequacy, as long as one wishes to estimate the properties of systems obeying the LNB scheme.
It is to be noted that for d = 2, where no inconsistency appears, the exact equality s = t holds (a consequence of
self-duality)36 and is obeyed by the Bruggeman exponents.
The above argument is to be brought together with another one by Bergman. Discussing the failure of a “non ambiguous” non-linear Bruggeman-type model, he concluded that bounds for fluctuations always refer to some particular
type of microstructure, and that no such bounds exist which apply to all materials4 .
Because of these problems, comparisons between effective-medium theories built on the Bruggeman formula, and
simulations on RRNs are expected to be more significant in dimension d = 2 (another reason for preferring the
two-dimensional case as a test-bench is that the bond percolation threshold pc = 1/2 on a square lattice is exactly
reproduced by Bruggeman’s formula). In Fig. 5 are displayed formulas (33) and (42) against p, in a high contrast
situation (ε2 /ε1 = 10000). The same trend as in Fig. 4 is observed: formula (33) yields a higher estimate. The values
for ε1,2 and χ1,2 are the same as that used in Fig. 3 of a paper by Levy and Bergman37 , where simulations results on
RRNs are reported, and compared to (42). The authors remarked that the height of the peak in χ0 at pc was badly
underestimated by (42), which gives χ0peak ≃ 0.5 only. In their numerical simulations, for a 30 × 30 network, the peak
height is found to be χ0peak ≃ 0.86. In the infinite-size limit, this value is expected to increase somewhat. In Fig. 5,
the height of the peak given by (33) is χ0peak ≃ 1.0, which thus compares fairly well to simulations.
E. Other power-law nonlinearities

In this section, potentials of the type (5) where1
wxnl (E) =

χ(x) γ+1

(53)

are considered. For simplicity, γ is assumed to be constant in the material. The gaussian averages over the field in
each phase are carried out numerically, with the help of a bi-variate integration routine. One integration variable is
the field modulus E, and the other is the cosine E · E0 /(EE 0 ). In fig. 6 are shown plots for
χ0 = hχ(E/E 0 )γ+1 i,

(54)

computed from gaussian averages, for a moderate dielectric contrast and various powers γ > 1 ranging from γ = 1.5
to γ = 5, against the volume fraction p of medium 2 (solid lines). An exponential enhancement of χ0 is observed with
increasing γ. Its origin lies in the existence of a non-zero probability for E > E 0 in the composite, since E0 = hEi
by definition. These fluctuations are amplified by the nonlinearity, while that for which E < E 0 are reduced. The
larger the width of the probability distribution, the larger this enhancement, so that the peak culminates in the region
p ≃ pc = 1/2. Once again, the estimates of the present theory are much higher than that predicted by the decoupling
assumption

(dashed lines), especially for large values of γ. This is understandable, since the functions to be averaged can be written
wxnl (E) = χ(x)f (E 2 ), where f (z) = z (1+γ)/2 /(1 + γ). For γ > 1, these functions are convex, so that hf (z)i ≥ f (hzi).
Therefore, the decoupling assumption always underestimates the fluctuations when applied to such potentials. An
overestimation would instead take place with concave potentials.
IV. CONCLUSION

In this article, a theory for the nonlinear susceptibility of weakly nonlinear composites is proposed. This theory is
based on a multimodal gaussian approximation for the overall probability distribution of the electric field, to linear
order. The parameters which define this distribution (means and second moments, in each phase of the disordered
medium), are obtained from Bruggeman’s theory, whose limitations are discussed in this context. The present model
provides for the first time an analytical estimate for the probability distribution of the electric field, for arbitrarily
high dielectric contrast, in percolating media. The resulting effective nonlinear susceptibility is exact to second order
8

in the contrast, and close to the exact result in the dilute limit. Significant quantitative improvement is obtained
on previous nonlinear effective-medium theories, even in the percolating regime, at least in the two-dimensional case.
This study emphasizes the importance of accounting for the vector character of the electric field when averaging the
local potentials. Improvements of the present theory could consist in finding a better approximation than the gaussian
one for the components of the probability distribution of the field. More realistic distributions could be obtained by,
e.g., extending the perturbative theory of Barthélémy and Orland22 to high dielectric contrasts via self-consistent
effective-medium approximations.

and the Bruggeman condition for ε0ij is hµij i = δij .
Formula (A1) has been derived by means of a functional formalism38 , used with a trial potential of the form39
W 0 (E) = (1/2)Ei ε0ij Ej + Pi0 Ei + c0 . Rather than to give a demonstration which would complicate the present article,
the validity of (A1) is established by looking at its consequences. First, one can easily check that, for a binary medium,
(A1) exactly reduces to formula (2.16) in the work by Ponte Castañeda and Kailasam15. Next, the average field per
phase, hEi iα = Miα , is (using the symmetry of the tensors g and µg; µ itself is not necessarily symmetric)
Miα =

From the definition of Pi0 , one deduces that hM i = E 0 , in agreement with the boundary conditions. Finally, the
macroscopic consitutive relation derived from the effective potential, namely
Di0 =

∂ W̃lin (E 0 )
= ε0ij Ej0 + Pi0 ,
∂Ei0

(A7)

is consistent with the equation

Di0 = hεij Ej + Pi i = hεα

(A8)

with Mjα computed with (A6). This directly follows from the equivalent form of the Bruggeman equation, hεij µjk i =

ε0ij hµjk i = ε0ij , and from the identity µα
ij = δij + µik gkl (εli − εli ).

It can be shown that the boundary condition hEi = E 0 truly corresponds to the more standard condition of uniform normal
induction on the boundary ∂V , namely ni Di = ni Di0 (see, e.g. Ponte-Castañeda21 ); we then have hDi = D0 ; but the
relationship (11) between D0 and E0 is known only after the homogeneization problem has been solved.
