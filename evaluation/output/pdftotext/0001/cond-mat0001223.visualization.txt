[38;5;1mI.[0m Introduction

Among various effective-medium formulas used to model the effective behavior of random conducting linear composites, the symmetrical Bruggeman formula [90m[\cite=BRUG35] [\cite=LAND52][0m is undoubtly the most popular. Applied to an insulator/conductor binary mixture, it predicts a percolation-like transition [90m[\cite=KIRK71] [\cite=CLER90] [\cite=STAU92] [\cite=SAHI98][0m for a volumic fraction of conductor pc 1 d, where d is the space dimension. The critical exponents are s t 1, and its critical properties are thoroughly discussed in Ref. [90m[\cite=CLER90].[0m This formula can be interpreted in two ways. On one hand, Milton has shown [90m[\cite=MILT85][0m that it yields the exact effective conductivity of an ad hoc ideal medium built with a particular hierarchical structure. On the other hand, the Bruggeman formula can be seen as a first (one-body) self-consistent approximation to general disordered symmetric cell-materials [90m[\cite=MILL69],[0m to which systematic corrections could be worked out. However, the Bruggeman approximation is very different from a mean-field theory of random conducting media. Indeed, an exact mean-field calculation on the Bethe lattice [90m[\cite=STIN73] [\cite=STRA74][0m predicts a percolation threshold pc 1 (2d) and exponents s 0 and t 3. These exponents are exact for d 6, as well as the asymptotic behavior of the threshold when d (at least, for the hypercubic lattice [90m[\cite=STAU92][0m to which a continuum theory naturally compares [90m[\cite=NOTE1]).[0m These values are also obtained in a more systematic mean-field theory for random resistor networks [90m[\cite=STEP77].[0m The remarkable discrepancy between the mean-field results and Bruggeman's formula indicates the ambiguous status of the Bruggeman theory. As a matter of fact, in spite of various (mostly perturbative) investigations [90m[\cite=HORI75] [\cite=BERG81] [\cite=LUCK91][0m in order to precise its theoretical status, the reasons for the peculiar critical behavior of Bruggeman's formula are not completely cleared up. More surprisingly, another self-consistent effective-medium approximation [90m[\cite=HORI75] [\cite=HORI77][0m due to Hori and Yonezawa (HY)obtained for the same type of media by means of a completely different approximation scheme (and later derived by functional methods [90m[\cite=BART93]),[0m exhibits the same exponents s t 1 and a similar threshold behavior pc 1 exp 1 d) 1 d.

[38;5;1m‖[0m Apart from phenomelogical variants, and up to our knowledge, the Bruggeman and HY effective-medium formulas are the only ones obtained from the equations of electrostatics in continuous media which are able to describe, at least qualitatively, the overall features of a percolation transition in any dimension. One intriguing question concerns the possibility of deriving alternative effective-medium formulas from a continuum formulation, which do not lead to the seemingly unavoidable values s t 1 and pc 1 d. As we show in this paper, such a possibility exists. Our starting point is the path integral approach recently put forward by Barthélémy and Orland [90m[\cite=BART98],[0mwhere the effective-medium problem is recast in a functional form. The problem reduces to compute a free-energy: roughly, the logarithm, averaged over the disorder, of a functional integral of Boltzmann-like weights, over allowed field configurations (which include boundary conditions)The average of the logarithm is carried out with the replica method (already used in Ref. [90m[\cite=STEP77]).[0m In Ref. [90m[\cite=BART98],[0m the authors showed that the path integral formulation allows one to easily recover the second-order weak-disorder expansion of the effective permittivity of nonlinear composites [90m[\cite=BLUM91].[0m

[48;5;167m1[0m

However, this formulation has not yet been used to derive self-consistent estimates. In this paper, we show how this can be done. After a presentation of the functional approach to the homogeneization problem, and of the replica method (Sec. [90m[\ref=pifotp]),[0m we discuss self-consistent effective-medium approximations (Sec. [90m[\ref=posa]).[0m As usual in such approximations, a background reference medium is introduced under the form of an ansatz for the energy of the system, whose parameters are to be determined self-consistently (Sec. [90m[\ref=o]).[0m The new feature here is that the ansatz contains a replica-coupling term, whose significance is explained (Sec. [90m[\ref=rcacota]).[0m The self-consistency conditions to determine its parameters are next discussed, and two types of effective-medium formulas are identified (Sec. [90m[\ref=sc]):[0m one in which the replica couplings are cancelled (hereafter referred to as "type 1"and the other one with non-zero replica couplings type 2"Two different approximations are then worked out for each type (Sec. [90m[\ref=tm]).[0m It is found that type 1 generates the Bruggeman and HY formulas, whereas type 2 brings in two new effective-medium formulas which are "replica coupling counterparts" of the previous ones. They possess exponents s 0, t 2, and a threshold pc 1 (2d) (Sec. [90m[\ref=nef]).[0m These new formulas are discussed in Sec. [90m[\ref=d],[0m where numerical results are presented before we conclude in Sec. [90m[\ref=c].[0m

[38;5;1m‖[0m Path integral formulation of the problem

The effective properties of a random conducting medium can be defined with the help of the total dissipated power in the medium [90m[\cite=WILL86][\cite=SANC87] [\cite=PONT92b].[0m In terms of the electric field E(x)the dissipated power w in the system of volume V reads

[38;5;1m‖[0m [90m[formula][0m

where wx is the local power density.

[38;5;1m‖[0m Hereafter, we take the volume V of the sample equal to one. In heterogeneous materials, wx depends on constitutive parameters randomly varying from point to point. For linear conducting media with j(x) σ(x)E(x)where σ is the local random conductivity and j is the electric current, we have

[38;5;1m‖[0m [90m[formula][0m

In the analogous effective permittivity problem the dissipated power is replaced by the stored energy ε(x)[90m[[0m[38;5;1mE 2[0m[90m/[0m[38;5;22mE2([0m[90m][0m x) 2 (ε is the permittivity)For this reason, we shall abusively refer to wx as the "energy density" hereafter. In the nonlinear problem, wx(E) is a non-quadratic function of E.

[38;5;1m‖[0m An alternative to solving Maxwell's equations is to minimize the total energy W subjected to the two constraints [90m[\cite=WILL86] [\cite=SANC87]: (i) [formula][0m and (ii) [90m[formula];[0m here, the bar stands for a spatial average, and E0 is a constant applied electric field.

[38;5;1m‖[0m The problem thus reduces to computing the average of the constrained minimum of a functional of the electric field. The electric field derives from a potential and has a fixed mean value. We can rewrite the constrained minimum in [90m([\ref=mini])[0m using a path integral

We plot in Fig. [90m[\ref=fig1] (resp. [\ref=fig2])[0m the "type 2" scaled conductivities [90m[formula][0m versus p, the volume fraction of material 2, for a dielectric ratio σ2 σ1 10 (resp. σ2 σ1 1000)We also show the Hashin-Shtrikman (HS) bounds [90m[\cite=HASH62], the Hori-Yonezawa[0m formula which comes from a cumulant series (CS) approximation, and the one-impurity (OI) Bruggeman formula. The dimension is d 2. Figs. [90m[\ref=fig3] and [\ref=fig4][0m display similar plots for d 3.

[38;5;1m‖[0m For moderate contrast (Figs. 1 and 3)we observe that all four self-consistent formulas lie close to each other. This is a consequence of the fact that they are exact to second order in the contrast. Also, for any contrast, the slopes at p 0 and p 1 are all identical, which is a consequence of the fact that they are exact to second order in the dilute limit p 0 (the expression near p 1 is obtained by replacing p by p 1 and by interchanging σ1 and σ2)We also observe that the HS bounds are satisfied in each case considered. However, the formulas obtained via the cumulant series summation, i.e. both the HY formula and its "type 2" counterpart, do not reduce to the exact result [90m[formula][0m in dimension 1 (not shown)This exact result is also the common value of the HS bounds for d 1. Hence, formulas derived from the cumulant series approximation do not obey the HS bounds in dimension d 1. On the other hand, both the Bruggeman formula and its "type 2" counterpart do reduce to the exact result when d 1, and can be seen to always obey the HS bounds whatever d is. The one-impurity approximation scheme therefore appears to be of better physical relevance for all dimensions, than the cumulant series approximation.

[38;5;1m10[0m

We now discuss the critical behavior. First of all, the percolation thresholds found in the"type 2" formulas are [90m[formula][0m (cumulant series) and pc 1 (2d 1) (one-impurity)These thresholds are the percolation thresholds of the Potts model, and that of the Bethe lattice model, respectively. Both thresholds decrease as 1 (2d) when d which is the exact asymptotics. The Bethe and Potts models are mean-field models, where emphasis is put on fluctuations in the couplings between a given site and its neighbours. On the contrary, in effective-medium theories, interactions between impurities are taked into account through the self-consistent background medium. Such interactions are more important for low dimensions. Effective-medium theories therefore overestimate interactions in high dimensions, whereas mean-field models are expected to underestimate them in low dimensions. Above the upper critical dimension where mean-field models are accurate, interactions between impurities become irrelevant. According to this discussion, our "type 2" formulas appear as hybrids between mean-field and usual effective-medium theories, and are expected to be mostly relevant in dimensions intermediate between d 1 and the upper critical dimension d 6. Indeed, the condition [90m[formula][0m minimizes the influence of the background medium and, according to the interpretation developped in Sec. [90m[\ref=rcacota],[0m replica coupling has to do with couplings between neighboring points. The reason for which the introduction of a replica-coupling ansatz yields the exact thresholds of mean-field theories [38;5;1m2[0m
[38;5;1m==[0m will have to be clarified in the future. In Fig. [90m[\ref=fig5],[0m we plot the quadratic fluctuations [90m[formula][0m as a function of p. The fluctuations in the "type 2" estimates are greatly reduced compared to those of the Bruggeman and HY formula. This is consistent with the fact that the influence of the background is reduced.

[38;5;1m‖[0m "Type 1" formulas give exponents s t 1, while for "type 2" formulas they are s 0, t 2. Mean-field theories yield s 0, t 3 which are the exact values for d 6. It is interesting to compare these values to exact bounds deduced from the Nodes-Links-Blobs (NLB) model, in all dimensions. The NLB model is currently accepted as a good one for the backbone structure of real random resistor networks [90m[\cite=STAU92].[0mThe bounds read

where ν 0 is the correlation length exponent: [90m[formula].[0m They hold for 2 d 6, whereas for d 6 the right-hand sides in [90m([\ref=expbounds])[0m are fixed to their d 6 values. These bounds follow, e.g.from comparing the lower and upper exact bounds obtained in Ref. [90m[\cite=WRIG86][0m for the noise exponent κ in weakly nonlinear networks, within the NLB scheme. They are satisfied by simulation results [90m[\cite=WRIG86].[0m Using the usual effective-medium values s t 1 in [90m([\ref=expbounds])[0m implies the absurd value ν 0, save for d 2 where a finite value of ν is allowed. Though information about the correlation length ξ (and therefore about ν) is not included in the Bruggeman nor in the HY formulas, the above bounds show that, as long as they are meant to model percolating systems obeying the NLB picture, these formulas are truly adequate only in dimension d 2 and d 1 where the Bruggeman formula is exact. As to "type 2" formulas, we insert the values s 0, t 2 into [90m([\ref=expbounds])[0m and deduce that ν 1 (d 2)a reasonable expression for d 3 only. If we furthermore insist on having ν 1 2 as in real systems, these heuristic arguments restrict the range of validity of the new formulas to d 3,4. Note, moreover, that only in dimension d 2 are the exponents equal: s t, because of self-duality [90m[\cite=STRA77].[0m A formula with unequal exponents therefore is expected to be essentially relevant to dimensions 3.

[38;5;1m‖[0m We also quote theoretical bounds for t due to Golden, valid for hierarchical NLB models: 1 t 2 for d 2,3 and 2 t 3 for d 4 [90m[\cite=GOLD90].[0m The above analysis is consistent with these bounds, and can be summarized as a set of prescriptions for using the "best" available effective medium theories, as far as a non-conflicting critical behaviour is concerned: for d 1, Bruggeman's formula, or its "type 2" counterpart are exact; for d 2, the Bruggeman or HY formulas are adequate; for d 3,4, "type 2" formulas are applicable; finally, for d 5 mean-field theories would be the most relevant. Estimates or exact values for the exponents are [90m[\cite=STAU92]:[0m (ν,s,t) (4 3,1.3,1.3)d 2, (0.88,0.73,2.00)d 3, (0.68,0.4,2.4)d 4, (0.57,0.1,2.7)d 5, (1 2,0,3)d 6. These values support our prescriptions.

[38;5;1m‖[0m We now consider some points that were not explicitly treated in the paper.

These will be presented elsewhere. Finally, we discuss the natural question about the possibility of replica-symmetry breaking [90m[\cite=PARI84].[0m Replica symmetry breaking introduces more free parameters in the ansatz, and the final extremization has to be carried out with respect to several variables. There is no frustration in this problem, and we therefore expect the replica symmetric solution to be the only one. In order to test this, we tried a one-step symmetry-breaking solution and did indeed not find any new solution.

[38;5;1mVI.[0m Conclusion

We presented a functional approach to the calculation of effective-medium properties of random media. We showed how to recover the Bruggeman and Hori-Yonezawa formulas by using specific approximation schemes to the basic functional integral. We also discussed the introduction of a replica-coupling parameter in a gaussian Ansatz, from which new effective-medium formulas were obtained. These formulas appear to be more adequate in d 3 compared to the standard ones by Bruggeman and HY. Because it yields a sensible result in all dimensions, and fulfills all the constraints required to deserve the label of a "good" effective-medium theory, the "type 2" counterpart of the Bruggeman formula offers an interesting alternative to the latter. Indeed, it has a percolation threshold equal to pc 1 5 in three dimensions. This is closer to values observed in real materials, compared to the pc 1 3 of the Bruggeman formula which often constitutes an overestimation.
