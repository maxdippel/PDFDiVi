model both numerically and analytically and find the existence of three regimes in traffic flow: free flow regime at
low densities (where each car moves with almost a constant velocity), fluctuative flow regime at inetrmediate
densities (where stable periodic oscillations of velocities
of all cars are observed) and congested or jammed flow
regime at high densities (where due to high density all
the cars tend to move with the same, relatively small
velocity). Our model predicts the existence of many inhomogeneous stable states in the fluctuative regime and
demonstrates hysteresis in transitions between free and
fluctuative regimes. The experimentally observed long
survival time of jams may be explained by our finding
that the fluctuations in the congested flow regime decay
slowly according to a power law.
To formulate the model we assume that car acceleration is affected by three factors:

A new single lane car following model of traffic flow is presented. The model is inertial and free of collisions. It demonstrates experimentally observed features of traffic flow such
as the existence of three regimes: free, fluctuative (synchronized) and congested (jammed) flow; bistability of free and
fluctuative states in a certain range of densities, which causes
the hysteresis in transitions between these states; jumps in
the density-flux plane in the fluctuative regime and gradual
spatial transition from synchronized to free flow. Our model
suggests that in the fluctuative regime there exist many stable
states with different wavelengths, and that the velocity fluctuations in the congested flow regime decay approximately
according to a power law in time.

In the last years, growing effort has been made in understanding traffic flow dynamics. Recent experiments
[1,2] show that traffic flow demonstrates complex physical phenomena, among which are:

(a) aspiration to keep safety time gap from the car
ahead,
(b) pre-braking if the car ahead is much slower,
(c) aspiration not to exceed significantly the permitted
velocity.

(i) The existence of three states: free flow, ”synchronized” (or ”fluctuative”) flow and traffic jams (for
low, intermediate and high densities correspondingly). The second state has two essential features:
synchronization of flow in different lanes (for the
multilane traffic) and fluctuation performed by the
system in density-flux plane. Since our model is
single-lane we will refer to this state as ”fluctuative”.

In mathematical description, the acceleration of the nth
car an is given by a sum of three terms depending on
its coordinate xn , velocity vn , distance to the car ahead
∆xn = xn+1 − xn and the velocities difference ∆vn =
vn+1 − vn :
an = A(1 −

(ii) Hysteresis which is observed in transitions between
the free and the fluctuative flow.

where A is a sensitivity parameter, D is the minimal
distance between consecutive cars, vper is the permitted
velocity and k is a constant. The safety distance ∆x0n =
vn T + D depends on T , which is the safety time gap
constant. The function Z is defined as Z(x) = (x+|x|)/2.
Note that Eq.(1) can be generalized by adding a noise
term.
In the following we discuss in more details the terms
in the right side of (1):

(iii) Long survival time of traffic jams.
Modeling of traffic flow is traditionally performed using
two approaches. The microscopic, or car-following models approach, which describes the nearest-neighbor interaction between two consecutive cars and investigates its
influence on the flow (see e.g. [3-5]), and the macroscopic, or continuous models approach, which represents
the flowing traffic as a continuous media and describes it
using the hydrodynamical partial differential equations
(see e.g. [7-9]). Wide surveys of these models are given
in [10-12].
In this Letter we inroduce an inertial single lane carfollowing model, which is free of collisions. We study the

(a) The first term plays an important role when velocity difference between consequtive cars is relatively small. In this case the nth car accelerates if
∆xn > ∆x0n and brakes if ∆xn < ∆x0n .
The choice of function in this term is not unique.
Replacing it by other functions of ∆xn which are
1

increasing, equal to zero if ∆xn = ∆x0n and tend
to −∞ if ∆xn → 0, such as A log(∆xn /∆x0n ), gives
similar results.

existence of velocity fluctuations for ρ1 < ρ < ρ2 . We
can therefore define three regimes in traffic flow: the
free flow regime (ρ < ρ1 ), the fluctuative flow regime
(ρ1 < ρ < ρ2 ) and the congested flow regime (ρ > ρ2 ).
Note that the flow in the first and the last regimes is
homogeneous. Note also that for small values of A ρ2 is
greater than the maximal possible density ρmax = 1/D
and the congested flow regime does not exist. See Fig.
1(b) for A = 2. This finding is supported by the analytical results shown below.

Unlike optimal velocity models [5] the acceleration in
our model depends explicitly on ∆x which enables us to
make the flow free of collisions.
The motion of cars is therefore described by the following system of ordinary differential equations

In the following numerical results we use parameters

5(m/s2 ) and k = 2(s−1 ).
The flux-density relation (often called the fundamental
diagram) for the homogeneous flow is shown in Fig.1(a)
as a dashed line. Comparison of this curve with the
fundamental diagrams (solid lines) obtained by the numerical solution of equations (2) for different values of
A starting from nonhomogeneous initial conditions indicates that for values of ρ smaller than some critical value
ρ1 or greater than another critical value ρ2 the flux is
the same, while for the intermediate values of density

In order to estimate the values of ρ1 and ρ2 we analyse
the stability of the homogeneous flow solution. The linearization of Eqs. (2) near the homogeneuos flow solution

Each of the N equations (6) has two solutions. These
2N different complex numbers are the eigenvalues of system (4). One of them (which corresponds to κ = 0) is
equal to zero regardless of values of parameters. In this
case all ξn in (5) are equal to a constant and belong to
the one-dimensional subspace of equilibria of system (4)
(defined by equations ξ1 = . . . = ξN , ξ̇1 = . . . = ξ˙N = 0).
This indicates that the disturbed state xn for z = 0 is
also homogeneous. For z 6= 0 ξn in (5) is a wave with
increasing or decreasing amplitude. Therefore, if we find
conditions under which other 2N − 1 eigenvalues have
negative real parts (the magnitude of wave (5) decreases
with time) we can say that under these conditions the
homogeneous flow solution (3) is stable.
Following the approach of [5] we can derive this condi2

A qualitative plot of S(ρ) is sketched in Fig.1(c). From
this figure it follows that depending on ρ we have three
regimes of stability/instability of the homogeneous flow
solution. If ρ < ρ′ (free flow) or ρ > ρ′′ (congested flow)
the homogeneous flow solution is stable and if ρ′ < ρ < ρ′′
it is unstable, where ρ′ = D+T1vper and ρ′′ = AT2 2 . Note
that there are possible sets of parameters under which
the minimum of the left part of S(ρ) can be less than
2 and the flow can have five different regimes of stability/instability. Nevertheless, under the set of parameters
specified above we have up to three regimes, where the
third regime does not exist for ρ′′ ≥ ρmax (A ≤ 2D/T 2).
Our numerical simulations show that ρ2 ≈ ρ′′ , but ρ′
is considerably greater than ρ1 , thus we expect that for
ρ1 < ρ < ρ′ both homogeneous and fluctuative states are
stable.
In the fluctuative regime (ρ1 < ρ < ρ2 ) the flow is
characterized by presence of humps (dense regions) moving backwards or forwards. When the flow has stabilized
the humps are equidistant and the evolution of traffic in
time and space resembles the spreading of a wave. The
existence of a fluctuative regime was predicted by other
car-following (e.g. [5] where it was called ”jammed flow”)
and continuous (e.g. [9], where it was called ”recurring
humps state”) models and measured experimentally [1].
Simulations of our model show that the fluctuative flow
state is not unique. Figs. 2(a-c) present the cars velocities after the fluctuative flow regime has stabilized for
three different initial conditions. It can be seen that the

”wavelengths” of these states are different. Fig. 2(d)
presents the convergence of flux in these experiments to
distinct values. Our simulations also show the existence
of solutions with other ”wavelengths” and flux values.
Fig. 2(e) shows the fundamental diargams for three different wavelengths. Consequently, depending on initial
conditions different stable fluctuative states emerge with
different values of flux and distances between neighboring humps. This indicates that for ρ1 < ρ < ρ2 system
(2) has many stable periodic (in ∆xn , vn variables) solutions, and hence in the 2N -dimensional space of variables
∆xn , vn there exist many attractive limit cycles.

solution.

As follows from above for ρ1 < ρ < ρ′ not only fluctuative flow solutions are stable, but also the homogeneous
flow solution. This bistability is the origin of hysteresis
in transitions between free and fluctuative flow regimes.
Such bistability was observed experimentally [1] and was
found in other models [5,6,9]. Fig. 1(d) shows a hysteresis loop in the density-flux plane. The upper curve is
obtained by increasing the density of cars adiabatically
preserving the road length L [14]. It can be seen that up
to the value of density ρ′ the homogeneous flow is preserved. The lower curve was obtained by adiabatically
decreasing the density in the same manner. While decreasing the density the flow remains fluctuative even for
ρ < ρ′ . Fig.1(e) presents the hysteresis loop in the global
density - velocities fluctuations plane.
Our results also illustrate the well-known phenomenon
[1,2,5,9,10] of jumps which the system performs in the
density-flux plane in the fluctuative flow regime when
the density and the flux are measured locally. In our

numerical simulation (Fig. 1(f)) we started from a value
of density below ρ′ , increased it gradually in the described
above manner up to a value greater than ρ′ and decreased
it back. These jumps may be explained by our finding of
many stable states in the fluctuative regime.
Our model also demonstrates the gradual spatial transition from the fluctuative to free flow in the downstream
direction which was measured by [1]. The results of local
measurements of density and flux at different distances
from an on-rump [15] are shown in Fig.3. which is in
good agreement with Fig.3 of [1].

of many stable periodic states in the fluctuative (synchronized) flow regime.

[14] Every new car is placed in the middle between two consecutive cars chosen randomly and gets the velocity of
the car ahead. The safety time gap of the new car and
the car behind is halved and then gradually increased
linearly up to the initial value T .
[15] Starting from a low value of density (free flow) the density
is increased by the influx fin = 0.133(veh/sec) at the
on-ramp situated at xin = L/4, where L = 10000(m).
The off-rump is at xout = 3L/4 and the outflux changes
instantly from 0 to fout = fin when the global density ρ
reaches the maximal value 0.03 (veh/m).

In the congested flow regime the only stable solution
is the homogeneous flow solution. We have not found
evidence of existence of bistability or hysteresis in transitions between the fluctuative and congested flow regimes.
Starting from random initial conditions, we observe that
initial fluctuations of the velocity seem to decay according to a power law

where t∗ is the crossover time between the power law

with z = 2.0 ± 0.1. These results are qualitivly similar to
that obtained by [11] for a cellular automata model [4],
but with different values of exponents. The result z ≈ 2
seems to be in agreement with random walk arguments
of [6]. For the parameters values A = 4, ρ = 0.15 we
get β ≈ 0.21 ± 0.04 (Fig.4).
