Abstract
In this paper we study in detail different types of topological solitons which
are possible in bilayer quantum Hall systems at filling fraction ν = 1 when spin
degrees of freedom are included. Starting from a microscopic Hamiltonian we
derive an effective energy functional for studying such excitations. The gauge
invariance and CP 3 character of this energy fuctional and their consequences
are examined. Then we identify permissible classes of finite energy solutions
which are topologically non-trivial. We also numerically evaulate a representative solution in which a pseudospin (layer degrees of freedom) bimeron in a
given spin component is intertwined with spin-skyrmions in each layer , and
and discuss whether it is energetically favoured as the lowest lying excitation
in such system with some numerical results.

I. INTRODUCTION

Systems which permit topological excitations, i.e. where field configurations can be
classifield by homotopy sectors characterised typically by some winding number, have been
studied in a general sense in mathematical physics for a long time. That such interesting
possibilities can actually arise and play a significant role in the Quantum Hall physics was
2

demonstrated in the work of of Sondhi et al [1]. They showed that for example , in a
single layer Hall liquid at filling factor ν = 1, the lowest energy excitations in spin, for low
Zeeman coupling are the so-called Skyrmions and not single spin flips. These Skyrmions
are topological excitations in the spin texture, in which the spin starts being, say, ”up”
at the origin and as you go outwards, starts tilting down in a flared manner to become
asymptotically ”down” spin at large distances. Subsequently experimental support for the
existence of such excitations was also discovered in NMR measurements [2].
Meanwhile Quantum Hall phenomena have also been studied in double layer systems [3],
[4]. The double well Hall plateaux at unit filling can be understood by associating with each
electron a ”pseudospin” in addition to its lowest Landau level (LLL) orbital wavefunction
[5], [6]. The up and down components of this pseudospinor give the probability amplitudes
for the electron being in the upper and lower layer respectively. The ground state of the
ν = 1 double layer system, known to be a quantum Hall state with a Hall conductivity
plateaux is a pseudospin ferromagnet, with the pseudospin aligned in the x-direction. This
is a very remarkable phenomenon in that it amounts to interlayer coherence between the
electrons in the two layers. This pseudospin degree of freedom is in addition to physical
spin. To start with, in analysing double layer phenomena, the spin degrees of freedom are
suppresed for simplicity. Even then one can still consider excitations in the pseudospin.
Inspired by the presence of Skyrmions in spin, people have also considered the possibility
of topological excitations in pseudospin. Such pseudospin textures called ”merons” and
”bimerons” have been suggested as possible low lying excitations of double layer systems [5].
The homotopy group π2 [S2 ] and its winding number are identical for spin and pseudospin
since mathematically pseudospin is identical to spin, both being SU(2) spinor fields on
a plane. The change in terminology from Skyrmions to bimerons does not indicate any
topological difference between the two in going from spin to pseudospin excitations but only
differences in their detailed profiles. This difference in turn happens because of the difference
in the energetics of spin and pseudospin and correspondingly , their asymptotic direction.
Meron excitations , if present in double layers, can give rise to a Kosterlitz-Thouless (KT)
3

[7] transition which may be enable them also to be experimentally observable.
Clearly there are prospects of even more esoteric excitations when both spin and pseudospin degrees of freedom are considered simultaneously. That is the theme of this present
work. We will continue to study the unit filling factor (ν = 1) case. There has already
been some discussion of the combined spin-pseudospin ν = 1 double layer system [8], [9].
Our work discusses diferent aspects of the problem than these studies. We analyse in substantive detail intertwined spin-pseudospin topological excitations of this system . When
both spin and pseudospin are active degrees of freedom , these are together described by
a 4-component object. This 4-component object has been referred to as a CP3 spinor in
the literature [9]. That is correct, but needs to be justified. A theory does not become a
CP3 theory just because its field is a normalised 4-component object. The system must
enjoy a U(1) gauge invariance, which is what makes the spinors span a projective space,
implied in the acronym CP. Without that gauge invariance the beautiful results on CPN in
the literature [10], [11] cannot be borrowed.
So we begin in sec. II by showing, starting from the basic microscopic theory of the
ν = 1 system that in the effective LLL theory for the spin-pseudospin texture such gauge
invariance is there. This is a straightforward derivation following the procedure developed
by Moon et al [6]. In fact we find that in the limit where the layer-separation d vanishes,
the Coulomb interaction energy is precisely the protoype CP3 Euclidean action used in the
pioneering papers on that topic [10], for which exact topological solutions are known in terms
of analytic functions. Of course, when d 6= 0, the energy functional is more complicated and
these analytical solutions do not hold. But the theory is still a CP3 theory, and the homotopy
classification of the solutions still holds. Only the solutions themselves have to be calculated
numerically.
A topologically non-trivial CP3 solution will generally involve an intertwined texture in
the physical spin in each layer as well as in the pseudospin of each physical spin projection.
One can ask whether such solutions can be legitimately interpreted as containing, as subsystems, spin-Skyrmions in either or both of the layers, possibly intertwined with a pseudospin
4

meron or bimeron . If so, then such possibilities of containing several topological entities
as subsystems has to be made compatible with the fact that any finite energy CP3 texture
carries altogether only one topological winding number. We study all these questions in
sec.III and find that there are certain restrictions on the types of solutions permitted. We
show that the individual layers of a double layer system cannot accomodate all possible spin
structures one may find in a pair of unrelated single layers. The spin winding numbers in
the two layers are related to one another and to the pseudospin winding number.
Consistent with these restrictions, we then pick in sec IV a representative ansatz which
can be viewed as a spin-Skyrmion intertwined with a pseudospin bimeron. We then numerically evaluate such a solution by solving the coupled nonlinear partial differential equations
that arise from extremising the texture energy functional. In earlier work [12], [13] we had
studied in some detail both meron and bimeron excitations in pseudospin for double layer
systems, with the spin degree of freedom suppresed. The present calculation is a more complicated version with CP3 spinors, but is done by similar numerical techniques. We present
the spin and pseudospin proflies of our intertwined solutions for different values of interlayer
separation.
We also estimate the interaction energy of these solutions for some typical sets of values of
system parameters. We discuss the dependence of this energy on the separation between the
two meron centers. We find , as expected, that if only the gradient and capacitance energies
are considered ,their minimisation will drive the textures towards zero size. Therefore we also
calculate the topological charge dependent Coulomb energy of our solutions which, being
repulsive , should drive the merons farther apart, offsetting the above tendency towards zero
size. Then we extremise the total energy so obtained and find that it does show a minimum
at some optimal meron separation, for each value of layer separation.
We also find that these energies are approximately of the same order as those of purely
spin Skyrmions of the single layer system. We make qualitative speculations on whether
or not our spin-pseudospin intertwined solitons can be energetically favoured over solitons
purely in spin or pseadospin, or over simple spin-flips.

II. TEXTURE ENERGY AND ITS GAUGE INVARIANCE

In a double layer quantum Hall system with both spin and pseudospin degrees of freedom
present, an electron will carry, apart from its coordinate wavefunction φX (~r), a 4-component
normalised spinor whose components in general may vary with the orbital quantum number
X. For any given X, this spinor can be denoted by


aσ (X)

where the spin-pseudospin index σ = 1, 2, 3, 4 corresponds to amplitudes that the electron
is in the upper-layer up-spin, upper-layer down- spin, lower layer up-spin and lower -layer
down-spin states respectively. It will henceforth be understood that the spinor is normalised,
i.e.

P

σ

| aσ (X) |2 = 1 for each X In the literature, this aσ has sometimes been referred to as a

CP3 spinor (see for instance Ezawa [9]). That is correct, but requires a little justification. In
a CP3 theory, the spinor must not only be normalised 4-component object, but be defined
only modulo a local gauge transformation common to all four components. This in turn
requires that the Euclidean action or static energy functional of the spinor field enjoy a
corresponding gauge invariance. In this section we will verify all this. We will also see that
the nature of the gauge symmetry is different for a double layer system than for a pair of
isolated single layers. This, as we shall see, has the important consequence of prohibiting
certain topological spin excitations in the double layer system which would have been present
in the individual layers had they been far apart. In this way, along with establishing the
CP3 nature of the system we will also identify permissible types of excitations where the
spin and pseudospin are nontrivially intertwined, some of which we numerically evaluate in
later sections.
Let us start by deriving the energy functional of any spin-pseudospin texture from the
microscopic Hamiltonian. This is just a straightforward generalisation of the procedure
6

already in the literature for the simpler case of a spinless bilayer problem [6]. Therefore we
need to present only the essential equations needed for completeness and understandability.
We take the microscopic Hamiltonian to be
H = HK + H1 + HC

(2.2)

Here
HK =

d~rψσ† D 2 ψσ

is the kinetic energy in the presence of the magnetic field. We will be working at ν = 1 in
the lowest Landau level (LLL) approximation. Corespondingly, the operator ψσ (~r) is the
LLL-projected electron field operator expanded in terms of Lowest Landau Level orbitals as
ψσ (~r) =

φX (~r) CσX

(2.4)

X=1

with φX (~r) being a LLL orbital, say, in the Landau gauge with X as its guiding center.
The second term in the Hamiltonian is the one body term representing the Zeeman and
interlayer tunnelling energies.

(2.5)

where σ̂z and τ̂x are spin and pseudospin matrices suitably generalised as 4 × 4 matrices on
the outer product space of spin and pseudospin.
The third term in the Hamiltonian is the Coulomb term :

(2.7)

where d is the interlayer distance. To obtain the energy of an arbitrary spin-pseudospin
texture, we adopt the strategy followed in the work of Moon et al [6]. We first consider the
ansatz state
| Ψi =

†
aσ (X)] | 0i
CσX

Y X

[

X

σ

(2.8)

where | 0i is the vacuum (no electron) state , X stands for Landau gauge orbitals and aσ (X)
is an orbital dependent 4-spinor as in eq.(2.1). In the high-B limit each Landau gauge orbital
density is uniform along the y-axis with support on a thin line localised around some value
of x. Further these states are closely spaced along the x-direction. Using this feature, we
will later on replace the orbital label X by the x-coordinate itself. In that case the above
texture aσ (X) depends only on the x-coordinate and not on y, and therefore carries zero
topological number density (see eq.( 3.14) below). Nevertheless we will use this ansatz to
calculate its energy functional, and then later that energy functional to the more general and
topologically non-trivial textures by invoking isotropy of the system in the x-y plane. This
was the exactly the strategy used in ref( [6]). We will calculate the energy functional of the
spin-pseudospin texture (2.8) by taking the mean value of the second quantised Hamiltonian
in that state .
At unit filling ν = 1, and in the space of LLL orbitals the kinetic term HK is just a
constant equal to (N/2)h̄ω ,the energy of the filled LLL band. This constant will henceforth
be neglected.
The Zeeman and tunnelling one-body energies yield

These direct and exchange Coulomb interaction matrix elements D s,d and E s,d between two
electrons in LLL orbitals X1 and X2 , in the same(s) or different(d) layers, are exactly the
same as were used in the spinless double layer problem by Moon et al [6]. However, the
inclusion of the physical spin degrees of freedom is reflected in the energy expressions in 2.15
and 2.16 , which involve all four components of the spin-pseudospin multiplet aσ .
Adding the contributions in eq.(2.14) and eq.(2.9) we get the total energy expectation
value
9

E[aσ (X)] = E1 [aσ (X)] + EC [aσ (X)]

(2.19)

In the Hartre-Fock approximation, this energy expectation value E[aσ (X)] in eq.(2.14) will
be minimised to get the ground state and excited state spin-pseudospin textures.
But, let us first examine the gauge invariance of the energy functional E[aσ (X)]. Consider
the transformation
aσ (X) → eiΛu (X) aσ (X)

f or σ = 1, 2

aσ (X) → eiΛl (X) aσ (X)

f or σ = 3, 4

(2.20)

Notice that we have used different phases Λu (X) and Λl (X) for the upper and lower layer
components respectively. This is a U(1) × U(1) transformation. These phases can also vary
with the orbital index X. [ Note : X is not the space coordinate. But, following accepted
approximations (see ref [6]) eventually the sum over the orbital index X will be converted
into an integral over space coordinate, invoking the fact that for large magnetic fields, each
LLL orbital wavefunction is highly localised. Hence the above X dependent transformation
corresponds to spatially local gauge transformations.]
Under these local U(1)×U(1) transformations, the one-body Zeeman energy in (2.9) and
the direct part of the Coulomb energy (2.15) are trivially invariant since they involve only
the squared-modulus of aσ (X) . So is the first part (proportional to E s ) of the exchange
Coulomb energy (2.16) . But the tunnelling energy in (2.9) and the second piece of the
exchange energy (2.16), which involves exchange Coulomb interaction E d between different
layers are invariant only if
Λu (X) = Λl (X) = Λ(X)

(2.21)

Thus the full energy of the double layer system enjoys only a U(1) subgroup of U(1) × U(1)
defined in (2.20) – a subgroup where all 4 components of aσ are transformed by the same
phase. This is the U(1) gauge invariance modulo which our CP3 spinors are defined.
Consider, however, what would happen if we had very widely separated ν = 1 layers
(the separation d → ∞). Then each can have its own 2-component spin texture described
10

by a CP1 system (equivalent to a non-linear O(3) sigma model) with its own U(1) gauge
symmetry (see [5] and [11]). The well separated pair of layers should enjoy U(1) × U(1)
gauge symmetry. Our derivation shows a similar effect. When d → ∞, both the tunnelling
parameter t in (2.9) and the interlayer Coulomb potential v d involved in (2.16) would vanish
and the full U(1) × U(1) gauge invariance would indeed be restored. We will see later that
this reduced gauge symmetry of a double-layer system at finite separation has consequences
in terms of what types of finite energy excitations are permitted in it as compared to a pair
of isolated single layers.

III. GRADIENT EXPANSION AND THE CP3 FIELD THEORY

To rewrite the energy expression 2.19 in a continuum field theory language, we proceed
following Moon et al [6] and convert sums over the LLL label X into an integral over space.
Clearly the one body energy (2.9), which involves only a single sum over the index X, will
become a local term, i.e. a spatial integral over the 1-body energy density. But the Coulomb
term (2.14) containing a double sum over X1 and X2 will become a non-local term involving
a double integral over some coordinates x1 and x2 . For long wavelength excitations one then
makes the usual gradient expansion . Expand the spinor for X2 as
aσ (X2 ) = aσ (X1 ) + ((X2 − X1 )

∂
aσ (X1 ) + .....
∂X1

(3.1)

Up till now we found the energy of textures which were y-independent.
Now we will invoke the isotropy of the basic system in the x-y plane and generalise this
expression for arbitrary textures by This is done by making the replacement

These constants are again the same as given by Moon et al [6] in the spinless double layer
problem. The term involving β represents the ”capacitance energy” of the double layer
system. It is proportional to the square of Fu (~r) − Fl (~r), which gives the difference in charge
density between the two layers. The constants ρs and ρd represent spin-pseudospin stiffness
coming from intralayer and interlayer Coulomb interaction respectively.
This energy functional 3.3 will act as the effective classical Hamiltonian to be minimised
to find different textured solutions. The ground state will correspond to a spatially uniform
texture, and so can be obtained by minimising the gradient-free terms in 3.3. This is acheived
by the spinor aσ (X) =

√1 (0, 1, 0, 1).
2

The one-body Zeeman and tunnelling energies are

clearly minimised by this choice since the spin is polarised ”down” in both layers and the
psuedospin is along the x-direction, i.e. a layer-symmetric state. This choice also minimises
the capacitance energy since it has equal occupancy in the two layers Fu = Fl = 21 .
12

Moving on to excited states with non-trivial textures, these are obtained by extremising
the full energy functional (3.3). Note that (3.3) including its gradient terms is still gauge
invariant under the local U(1) transformation mentioned earlier,
aσ (X) → eiΛ(X) aσ (X)

(3.7)

so that this is still a CP3 theory. In fact the term proportional to the isotropic spinpseudospin stiffness ρs , namely ,

is the Euclidean action for the prototype minimal CP3 theory [10]. Indeed, in the limit
where the layer separation d is zero, this ECP will be the only surviving term from the
Coulomb energy in 3.3 since the interlayer and interlayer Coulomb potentials will become
equal ( (v s = v d )) and hence both β and ρs − ρd will vanish.
The properties of this prototype CP3 system and its topological solitons are well known
[10], [11]. Let us briefly recall those salient features which will be of relevance to us. Define
a gauge field Aµ as follows.

Since Aµ is independent of the spinor index σ, this implies ( see [11]) that as ~r → ∞,
13

aσ → bσ eiφ(θ)

(3.13)

where bσ is some constant spinor . The important point is that all four components of aσ
have the same asymptotic phase φ which may depend on the spatial angle θ. The underlying
reason is that the system is invariant under the same single U(1) gauge transformation 3.7
acting on all the four components of aσ . Finally, the phase function eiφ(θ) as ~r → ∞ is
a mapping of one circle (spatial infinity) into another (the U(1) group manifold), and can
therefore be divided into homotopy classes characterised by a winding number

For more details supporting these results see ref [11]. Exact soliton solutions for the minimal
CP3 system also known analytically in terms of analytic functions. Those will not however
hold for our full system 3.3 which has to be used when the layer separation d 6= 0. The solutions will have to be obtained numerically by using appropriate ansatz. But the boundary
condition 3.13 and the winding number classification will still hold. They can be used to
decide what forms of intertwined spin-pseudospin solitons are permitted in double layers.
An important consequence of the common phase boundary condition 3.13 is that certain
spin textures one can imagine having for two separate single layers are not permissible in
the double layer system. Consider a single layer at ν = 1 carrying a Skyrmion with winding
number n. This is a finite energy configuration which can be described by a 2-component
spinor, say,

(3.15)

One can have two such layers, widely separated, with two different spin-winding numbers
n and m respectively. Nothing prohibits this . However suppose the two layers are part of
a ν = 1 double layer system at finite d , and are described by a CP3 4-spinor

This would violate the condition 3.13 since asymptotically the second and fourth components
would have different phase functions. Such a texture is forbidden as per our analysis and
indeed if one calculates its energy by inserting it in 3.3 one will find the energy diverging
logarithmically. The divergence comes from the angular derivative of

(3.17)

as r → ∞ which will lead to a logarithmic divergence unless n = m. At the theoretical level
the reason for this can be traced to the reduction of gauge symmetry discussed earlier, from
U(1) × U(1) to U(1) when two layers are together.
Keeping in mind this constraint of equal spin-winding numbers in each layer, let us illustrate non-trivially intertwined spin-pseudospin configurations with the following example

A = (λ21 + | z − b |2 +λ22 + | z + b |2 )−1/2 is the normalisation factor. Asymptotically, the
15

first and third components of 3.18 both behave as

√1 eiθ
2

while the other two components

vanish. This is therefore a permitted (energetically finite) CP3 configuration with winding
number Q = 1.
One can see that this example is so designed that within each layer the spin texture
looks like that of a single Skyrmion, while at the same time it is also a ”bimeron” in the
”psuedospin of the down-spin component” (contained in the second and fourth components
of the 4-spinor of 3.18. See ref ( [13]) for more on bimerons.) But, we should remember that
the the upper and lower layers are not separately normalised in the example 3.18. As ~r varies
so does the relative charge density in the two layers. Thus the spin vector in the upper (or
lower) layer in 3.18 will not be a unit vector at every point unless it is is locally renormalised
by the charge density of that layer at that point. Similarly, while the pseudospin of the
down-spin component in the example 3.18 forms a bimeron, this pseudospin will also be a
unit vector at each ~r only after being renormalised by the down-spin density, which varies
from point to point. Such renormalisation can be achieved by writing any general CP3
4-spinor (2.1) in terms of spin and pseudospin polar angles.

where the angles θu.l , and φu,l are the polar angles of the spin in the upper(lower) layer
while α and β are the polar angles of the pseudospin, each of which is a the function of
the coordinate ~r. (Recall that CP3 spinor has 6 real gauge invariant degrees of freedom.
) Suppose we tentatively define, using these polar angles the familiar expression for the
spin-Skyrmion number in each layer by

One can then verify that the configuration 3.18 indeed yields unit spin-winding numbers
nu,l = 1 in each layer.
16

Similarly , to get the pseudospin winding number one uses an alternate parametrisation
of the same 4-spinor.

written as

nps (↓) =

Z

d2 rǫµν ∂µ (cosα↓ ) ∂ν (β↓ )

(3.22)

Again, the example 3.18 happens to yield nps (↓) = 1 in addition to, as we have seen, nu,l = 1 .
Thus the example 3.18 illustrates an intertwined spin- pseudospin topological configuration,
containing the spin texture of a Skyrmion in each layer and the pseudospin texture of a
bimeron in the down-spin component.
One should however be cautioned that there is only one true topological charge Q in
the full CP3 theory, given in eq. (3.14). Although the above example (3.18) contains the
texture of two Skyrmions and a bimeron, its CP3 topological index Q obtained by inserting
it into eq. (3.14) will come out to be not 3 , but unity. The separate sub-charges for spin
and pseudospin defined in (3.20) and (3.22) in general do not have the same sanctity as they
would have had for Skyrmions in a single layer or bimeron in a spinless problem. Although
in the above example these separate spin and pseudospin winding numbers turn out to be
integers, in general they need not be integers , or more importantly , be conserved in time.
They are not protected by homotopy considerations in our full 4-component theory. The
angles θu,l etc used in 3.19 cannot always be obtained from the original components aσ of the
4-spinor 2.1 , since they are not defined at those singular points where α = π, 0 respectively.
A similar remark holds for the other angles used above. The numbers nu,l and nps can
change in time due to leakages through such singular points . It is however interesting to
note that the exact CP3 winding number can be rewritten in expanded form using the angles
17

defined in 3.19 into parts that can be attributed to winding of spin and pseudospins. This
also brings out the intertwining of spin - psedospin texture . We have,

quantities as in (2.10,2.11) and denote the number density in the top and bottom layers.
For the spinless (spins fully frozen) case one can set θu , θl , φu andφl to be constants. Then

(3.25)

In the general, where both spin and pseudospin havesome intertwining texture, the full
topological charge will receive contributions from the windings of all these, as given in 3.23.
Finally, the very simple example 3.18 not only illustrates a nontrivial intertwining texture
, it is also an exact solution of the prototype CP3 theory 3.8 since its components are
analytic functions (see ref [11]). But, for our full theory in the presence of a non-zero layer
separation and with Zeeman and tunnelling energies , classical solutions minimise the full
energy functional 3.3, have to be obtained numerically by solving the non-linear coupled
partial differential equations that the minimisation conditions yield. The simple analytical
example 3.18 however will guide us in setting up the desired ansatz for the numerical solution
with appropriate boundary conditions so that intertwined textures which are nontrivially
wound in both spin and pseudospin can be obtained for our full theory. An illustrative
family of such solutions is obtained in the next section.

IV. FIELD EQUATIONS AND THEIR SOLUTIONS

Classical solutions that minimise the full energy functional 3.3 have to be obtained
numerically. To do this we use the parametrisation of the spinor components of the form

One can see that this is a sub-family of the general case in eq (3.19) where for simplicity
we have set θl equal to π and β = 0.
We will look for numerical solutions which would have corresponded ,if the energy had
been of the simple prototype functional (3.18), to its exact analytic solution

This configuration represents a spin skyrmion in the upper layer intertwined with a
bimeron in the ” pseudopsin of the downspin component”. It does not have any non-trivial
winding in the real spin of the lower layer (though the fourth component in the spinor varies
over the coordinate space the spin will be always down). To ensure that our numerical
solutions have the same topological properties as well as similar profiles as the prototype
spinor (4.2) we impose the same boundary conditions on the components of the former as
obtained in the latter, both asymptotically and at the meron centers centres x = ±b.

(4.3)

This energy functional has to be minimised with respect to all the angle fields in the
anstatz. As we did in our earlier work on the spinless problem [13], here too we will use the
bipolar co-ordinate system [16] to describe the spatial plane.
η = ln|z − a| − ln|z + a| ; φ = arg(z − a) − arg(z + a)

(4.4)

We have already elaborated in [13] the advantages of this co-ordinate system when one
has to impose the bimeron -type boundary conditions. However here the advantages of
introducing such an unfamiliar co-ordinate system is not as much as in the simple spinless
bilayer problem of [13] because the ansatz here is not symmetric between the two layers.
Consequently unlike the spinless case cos α is no more antisymmetric about η = 0 axis. All
these features along with the fact that the energy minimisation unavoidably requires solving
coupled non-linear partial diffential equations ( p.d.e.) render the numerical exercise much
more complicated here . What we have done under these circumstances is the following.
We have solved the field equations numerically for the case where just the capacitance
term is added to the minimal CP3 energy . ¿From our earlier calculations we know that
this term is going to change the solutions considerably. The terms in each equation with the
coefficient (ρs −ρl ), which accounts for the anisotropy in the exchange energy is not included
in the process of numerical integration. As a justification of such simplification we can say
that the anisotropic terms which involve higher order gradients of the spin pseudospin field
will have less pronounced effect compared to the capacitance term on the solutions. This
has been graphically shown in Fig. 1 and 2 of our earlier work [13]. Even after this drastic
simplification we are still left with solving four coupled non-linear p.d.e’s . For example, the
equation which is obtained by extremising the energy w.r.t cos α is

is the Jacobian of this coordinate transformation and all gradient operators are defined in
the bipolar-coordinate system [16]. Similarly we wil have three more equations obtained by
extremising the energy functional with respect to θu , φu , φl and then writing the resulting
equations in bipolar co-ordinates. We will not display them here.

A. Numerical Procedure

The numerical procedure is almost same as that in Ref. [13]. Here also one can see that
the Jacobian factor Qs in the first term of the eq. 4.5 is singular at the point (η = 0, φ = 0).
The behaviour of cos α near this point is also going to be same as the behaviour of mz in
ref. ( [13]). The major difference compared to the earlier problem however comes from the
fact that it is no longer sufficient to find out the solutions in one quadrant and get the rest
from symmetry considerations. We have to solve this problem on both side of the η = 0 axis
since our starting ansatz solution is not completely antisymmetric around η = 0. During
the numerical work one also has to be careful about the different branches of the angles
φu,l . As one needs to integrate the equations on the both sides of the η = 0 axis the size
of the mesh on which we have to discretise the field equations becomes larger compared to
the earlier case of spin-frozen double layer problem [13]. Also here we have to solve four
21

coupled p.d.e’s simultaneously. This simultaneous increase in the number of lattice points
as well as independent fields demands that we have to invert a huge determinant in the
Newton-Raphson procedure [17] while improving over the initial guess solution. This forces
us to increase the lattice constants of the mesh slightly compared to what we have done in
our earlier work [13]. However we have checked that the error introduced in this way is not
very high. In the next subsection we shall present our results along with the discussion.

B. Results and Discussion

Our solutions of eq.(4.5) along with the other three field equations yield the spatial
behaviour of the CP3 fields parametrised in term of the angles α , β ,θu,l and φu,l . The
calculations are done iteratively. We start with the simple analytical spinor 4.2 which is
the exact solution when the capacitance and anisotropy terms in the energy (4.6)are absent.
Then the capacitance term in the equation is introduced in small steps and the corresponding
solution obtained numerically. We have performed several calculations each starting from
different initial values of the constants λ and b . The constant λ represents the starting value
of the first component of the spinor in the iteration process. It stands for the spin-Skyrmion
size in the CP3 limit, but when subsequent iterations are performed in the presence of other
energy terms, it is replaced by a space dependent solution. But the parameter b is fixed for
a given calculational run. It represents the meron separation and enters into the equation
(4.5) explicitly through the first (capacitance) term. While we do calculations for different
values of b, the optimal value of b will have to be obtained by minimising the energy with
repsect to it. We will return to this point later.
We present below the salient features of our numerical results. The major feature we want
our numerical solution to have is the intertwining of the spin skyrmion with the pseudopsin
bimeron . We would also like to show the leakage of electrons of either spin from one layer
to another as we move in space, as a fallout of this intertwining. To show this , we have
plotted both cos α as well as cos α↓ as a function of η for a set of values of the angle φ in
22

Fig.1 and Fig. 2 respectively. These solutions correspond to layer separation d = 0.6l ,
bimeron center-separation b = 2.5l and starts from an initial value of λ = 1 in the starting
trial solution 4.2. The sequence of curves shown correspond to φ equal to 0.09π, 0.36π,
0.63π, and 0.90π respectively with the outermost one belonging to φ equal to 0.09π. As we
have discussed earlier [13], Note from the definition of the bipolar coordintaes that spatial
infinity in x-y plane corresponds to η and φ both equal to zero. As we approach this point
in the φ, η plane, the solution should damp exponentially as exp(− √
κ =

η2 +φ2

where
(4.7)

. Correspondingly we see in Fig. 1 and 2 that the low φ curves rise very slowly as η increases
away from zero.
The interesting point to note about these solutions is that in Fig. 1 cos α approaches different (absolute) asymptotic values as η approaches ±∞.(These are respectively the centers
of the two merons that form the bimeron. Although computational limitations allow us to
go only upto values 0f η = ±3, it is clear from the figure that asymptotic behavior has been
obtained ). This asymptotic behaviour is extracted directly from the analytic ansatz 4.2
and implies the leakage from the pseudospin to spin. It is useful to remember at this point
that we have a bimeron only in the ”pseudospin of the down-spin componenet” whereas
cos α represent the z-component of the total pseudospin. This is realised in Fig. 2. Here
cos α↓ (down − spin) represent the z-componenet of the ”pseudospin of the down-spin component”. It is completely antisymmetric about η = 0 and approaches ±1 as η approaches
±∞. This behaviour is same as the behaviour of mz in the spinless bilayer case. This is how
we can extract from our results the pure bimeron by suitably partitioning the pseudospin
into different spin components.
Since bipolar co-ordinates are not very familiar we have given an alternate representation
of the above results through a vector-plot in the physical x-y space in Fig. 3 and 4. The
values of the parameters in these figures are same as those in Fig.1. In Fig. 3 the magnitude
of each arrow gives the absolute value of the transvere component of the total pseudospin
23

sin α and it’s angle with the x-axis gives (φu − φl ). One should note in this regard the
(φu − φl ) = β↓ in the other parametrisation Here also one can see the length of the arrow
does not quite vanish in one of the bimeron centres and makes this construction singular
at this point. However when we look at the Fig. 4. where the magnitude of each arrow is
sin αdownarrow and the angle is again (φu − φl ) , the magnitude of the arrow vanishes at each
bimeron centre and the profile is no more singular. This makes Fig. 4 identical to the vector
plot of the bimeron pseudopsin in the pure layer case [15], [13].
In Fig 5.we have given a similar vector plot for the spin skyrmion in the upper layer.
Here the length of the each arrow corresponds to the planar projection of the spin in the
upper layer (sin θu ) and the its direction gives the azimuthal angle (φu ) of the projected
vector .This picture very clearly points out how the skyrmion winds in the azimutahl plane
about it’s centre at x = b Here also the layer separation d and the starting values of b and
λ are the same as those in Fig. 1 . This set of parameters represents a typical example.
Lastly, we have evaluated the energy of these solutions for a set of values of the meron
separation parameter b .The optimal value of b should be obtained by minimising the full
energy as a function of b. But if we include only the capacitance term and the (pseudo)spinstiffness gradient terms in our energy, these will not lead to a non zero b, i.e the textures
will want to shrink to zero size. The reason is that under rescaling, the capacitance term
grows proportional to the square of the scale while the gradient terms are scale invariant. Of
course a change in b will not result in just an overall rescaling of the solution. The shape of
the solution will also change since b occurs as a constant multiplying the capacitance term in
the differential equation (4.5). As a result, the b dependence of the gradient and capacitance
terms will not be simple, although qualitatively it should still drive the meron separation
to zero size. This can be seen in Table 1, where we show these energies for ten different
values of b for a fixed value of other parameters. As expected the sum of both these energy
contributions decreases strongly with decreasing b, thus driving the texture to zero-size. In
reality however, these two terms are just the first two terms in the gradient expansion of
the full energy functional. Higher order terms in the gradient expansion, if included, will
24

make our nonlinear differential equation even more difficult to solve, but they can offset this
tendency to shrink.
In particular, one prominent higher gradient contribution to the energy is the Coulomb
interaction between different portions of the topological charge densities. It is given by (see
[8]) :
ECoul

1Z
=
d~rd~r′V (~r − ~r′ )δρ(~r)δρ(~r′ )
2

(4.8)

where δρ(~r) is the CP3 topological charge density given by the integrand of the r.h.s of the
equation (3.14).
Inclusion of the contribution of this term into our differential equation for the texture
will introduce a nonlocal nonlinear term, which will make it very difficult for us to solve
it numerically. We can however make the following estimate. We can insert our texture
solution , obtained without the Coulomb term , into the Coulomb energy integral and
evaluate it as a function of b. This contribution is also shown in the Table 1. As expected,
the coulomb repulsion energy ECoul decreases with increasing b. This term would like to
keep the merons farther apart, and offset the tendency to shrink because of the other terms.
Thus one may hope to get an optimal bimeron separation at which the sum of all these three
energy contributions will get minimised as a function of b.
In Table 1 we have presented our calculation for the layer separation d = .8l where
different contributions to the total energy are shown along with the their sum, the ”total
energy”. For this particular layer separation a distinct minimum is obtained around b = 2.0l.
To see whether this behaviour is common to other layer separations we have plotted in
fig.6 the total energy Etotal as a fuction of bimeron separation b for a set of layer separations.
The three sets of points in this figure corespond to three different layer separations, namely
d equal to .5l, .7l and .8l. All these three curves show distict minima for the total energy
as a function of bimeron separation. We have also provided in Table 2 the size (b) and total
energy of the optimal bimeron for five values of layer separation.
Notice from Table 2 that the optimal meron separation b decreases with the increase of
25

layer separation d . For d = .8l the optimal separation is around b = 2.0l and gradually
increases to b = 2.5l for d = 0.4l . For the case of pure layer bimeron Brey et. al. also
found ( [15]) a similar behaviour. This behavior could be attributed to the following. By
lowering the layer separation (decreasing the

d
l

ratio) one increases the relative importance of

Coulomb repulsion among topological charge densities (coming from the intra-layer Coulomb
energy) to the Capacitance term (coming from the interlayer Coulomb repusion). Hence the
balancing of the capacitance term by the Coulomb energy will take place at a larger bimeron
separation, thereby increasing the size of the bimeron.
We found that resulting energy of these solitons at their optimal sizes varies very little as
one changes the layer separation. Although bimerons of larger size at lower layer separations
cost higher capacitance energy , the decrease in the Coulomb energy seems to fully offset
that. As a result the total energy remains almost the same for different layer separations in
the range d = 0.4l to d = 0.8l that we have studied.
An important question is whether our spin-pseudospin intertwined solution has a lower
energy than other candidates among the low-lying excitations. Prominent among these other
low lying excitations with whom such comparisons have to be done are (i) the particle-hole
excitations and (ii) purely spin or pseudospin textured solitons. To start with note that in
the minimal prototype CP3 system (valid in the d = 0 limit ; see 3.8) the energy is just equal
to ECP = 4πρs Q (see ref. ( [11]). Now , a pure-spin skyrmion in, say, one of the layers
can also be written in our CP3 4-spinor notation and will have a CP3 topological number
Q = 1. So will a bimeron in pseudospin of some spin component. Therefore in the prototype
CP3 system our spin-pseudospin intertwined soliton with Q = 1 will have the same energy
as a purely spin or pseudospin textured soliton with Q = 1. The intertwining will not cost
more energy. All these energies which are equal, are a quarter of that of a particle-hole pair
(see ( [8]) which costs an energy of

q

π
2

≈ 1.25 in units of

e2
ǫl

. However the difference in the

energies of these various types of topological excitations come from the additional terms in
the full energy EC due to capacitance , anisotropy and Coulomb repulsion. As we can see
from the Table 2 that our intertwined soliton over a range of layer separation has energy
26

around .60

e2
.
ǫl

It is encouraging that a pair of these excitations would have somewhat lower

energy than the particle-hole pair energy of 1.25.
Of course our computational accuracy is not very high, given that we are limited in
how many lattice points we can use. One must also improve on the results by solving
for the texture functions and their energy after including single particle terms due to the
Zeeman coupling and tunelling . Examples of such calculations can be found in the case of
ν = 2 by Pardes et. al. [14] , but not for ν = 1 yet to date. Meanwhile, our result for the
intertwined soliton at ν = 1 and its energy at best raise hopes that they may be competetive
as candidates for low lying excitations in double layer systems with spin.

is equal to 2.5l. The value of λ in the analytic ansatz is 1l
FIG. 2. The plot of cos αdownspin(↓) (η) for a set of values for φ.The curves correspond, as one
goes inwards, to φ = 0.09π, 0.36π, 0.63π, 0.90π respectively with the outermost one corresponds to
φ equal to 0.09π. The layer separation d is again equal to 0.6l and bimeron separation b is equal
to 2.5l. The value of λ in the analytic ansatz is also 1l
FIG. 3. This figure gives the magnitude and direction of x-y projection of the total pseudospin
at different points on the plane. The magnitude of each arrow at a given point is sin α and it’s
angle with the x-axis is (φl − φu ) at that point. The layer separation and the bimeron separation
are same as in Fig. 1 and 2
FIG. 4. This figure gives the magnitude and direction of x-y projection of the ” pseudospin
in the down-spin component” at different points on the plane. The magnitude of each arrow at a
given point is sin α↓ and it’s angle with the x-axis is β↓ at that point. The layer separation and
the bimeron separation are same as in Fig. 1 and 2
FIG. 5. This figure gives the magnitude and direction of x-y projection of the spin in the upper
layer at different points on the plane. At each point the magnitude of the arrow gives sin θu and
it’s direction with x-axis gives φu at that point. The layer separation and the bimeron separation
and initial λ are the same as in the earlier figures
FIG. 6. This figure gives a plot of the total energy E(total) as a function of the bimeron
separation b for three different layer separations, namely d = 0.5l, 0.7l and 0.8l The unit of energy
is again
