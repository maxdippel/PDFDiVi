Introduction

Since the discovery of 
<AND>
in 1991 [\cite=Iijima] a lot of progress has been made in the synthesis as well as in the characterization of the electronic, optical and mechanical properties of these remarkable molecules [\cite=book] [\cite=book1] [\cite=book2] [\cite=dekker_pt]. They are promising structures to use as components in submicrometer-scale devices [\cite=devices] [\cite=pipe] and in nanocomposites [\cite=nanoc]. A carbon nanotube can be visualized as a graphite sheet rolled up seamlessly into a cylinder. They have diameters in the range of 0.6-30 nm and are many microns in length. Depending on the synthesis conditions they can appear in multi-walled or single-walled configurations [\cite=Iijima] [\cite=Smalley] [\cite=Catherine]. The tube symmetry determines not only the electronic (metallic or semiconducting) character [\cite=book2]but also the plastic/brittle behavior [\cite=Marco][\cite=Paul]. The special geometry makes the nanotubes excellent candidates for mesoscopic quantum wires. Evidence for (1D) quantum confinement was obtained from electronic transport measurements on single-walled nanotubes [\cite=Dekker]. The transition from one-dimensional (wire) to zero-dimensional (quantum dot) behavior can be achieved directly by cutting a long nanotube to a shorter length.

Nanotubes are cut by the following procedure: During
imaging of a nanotube in constant-current mode, scanning is interrupted and the STM tip moves to a selected
position on the nanotube. Feedback is then switched off
and a voltage pulse between tip and sample is applied for
1 ms. After this pulse, the feedback is switched on again
and scanning resumes where imaging was interrupted.
The distance between the STM tip and the nanotube
during a pulse is determined by the settings for the feedback current and voltage. Fig. 1(b) shows an example of
a nanotube that has been cut into various smaller tube
pieces as a result of voltage pulses of -3.75 V applied at
the positions marked in Fig. 1(a)Often, tube parts beneath the STM tip are picked up during a pulse. This
usually leads to degradation of the tip quality. Cleaning
of the tip can then be done by applying voltages on the
gold surface, away from the nanotube.

PHYSICAL CONCEPTS FOR THE CUTTING
MECHANISM

In this Section we survey a number of possible physical
mechanisms for the breaking of nanotubes by a voltage
pulse that are interrelated to various degrees [17]Shear pressure; Simply crashing the tip into the
tube could be a possible cutting mechanism. However, experimentally we find that the tubes are
moved laterally when the tip is brought close to
the tube. This is related to the large reversible elastic response (flexibility) exhibited by carbon nanotubes [18]Simulations of C60 -molecules impact
on carbon nanotubes have shown that even large
radial forces produce reversible elastic distortions
indicating that crashing the tip onto the tube is not
an efficient method to cut [19]Furthermore, there
is no obvious energy scale of 4 
<AND>
eV in the crashing
process.

Crack propagation; This is related to the propagation of voids and cracks already present in asgrown nanotubes under low (tensile) loads. However, there is no evidence, from STM or otherwise,
for the presence of local defects or cracks in the
SWNT material studied here. This mechanism is
hence not considered to be important.

Collective excitations (plasmons)Plasmons excited by inelastic electron scattering of the tunneling current can decay into electron-hole pairs,
phonons or other excitations that induce a polarization or charge separation in the tube. Eventually the release of the plasmon energy leads to
a break through local heating and atom evaporation. Due to the particular cylindrical geometry of
carbon nanotubes we expect to have a π-plasmon
excitation at about 5 eV [20]This has been confirmed experimentally [21] for SWNTs of 1.4 nm
diameter. The decay of the plasmon excitation into
atom evaporation is a well-known phenomenon in
metallic clusters where the surface-plasmon energy
is of the order of the binding energy leading to
atom-evaporation as an effective decaying mechanism of the collective excitations [22]In the case of
tubes with an internal binding energy greater than
7 eV/atom (as for most carbon solids; see Table
I)however, multiple-plasmon excitations need to
be active to induce transitions which weaken the
carbon bonds. This puts this mechanism behind
first-order models. However, it can enhance the
probability of electronic excitations (see below)

Field-induced elastic deformation; The large electric field from the tip apex causes significant
changes in the C-C bond lengths. This introduces a
mechanical instability in the tube that triggers the
formation of topological defects (double pentagonheptagon defect pairs, see Fig. 6) [24,25] that dynamically evolve towards breaking of the tube (see
next section for details) [26]This effect is enhanced by the stress introduced in the nanotube
during the electronic excitation of localized σ-states
(as discussed in the previous mechanism)The induced stress acts on the tube for the whole 1 ms
applied voltage pulse which is long enough for the
formation and evolution of the dislocation cores.
The combination of the last two processes is the most
likely to constitute the basic mechanism for cutting of
nanotubes. The cutting process then is triggered by the
inelastic electron excitations involving transitions of localized σ-states at about 3.6 eV. This accounts for
the threshold voltage found in the experiments. The CC bonds are further weakened by the mechanical stress
induced by the large electric field between tip and sam3

In the calculations shown in Fig. 5 the field acts on
the whole tube for fixed atomic coordinates. Results are
shown corresponding to electric fields accessible in the experimental setup (up to 1 eV/Å)One could also take into
account the spatial variation of the applied field related
to the tip-size. In that case there are distinct regions:
one far from the tip where the electronic properties of
the tube are dictated by the isolated tube and the other
just beneath the tip where the electronic properties are
modified by the applied field. From Fig. 5 we see that the
applied field results in the appearance of localized levels
which increases the DOS in an energy region close to the
Fermi level (this effect is related to the bond-weakening
and bond-length increase in carbon nanotubes under an
applied voltage discussed above)The increase of density of states near the Fermi level enhances the number
of possible transitions that can take place. Semiconducting nanotubes have a DOS comparable to that of metallic
nanotubes, but have an energy gap with zero DOS near
the Fermi energy. However, the electric field will induce
states within the gap, similar to the increase of DOS
near the Fermi level for metallic nanotubes. This allows
localized particle-hole excitations to take place also for
semiconducting nanotubes. Indeed, in the experiments

It may appear that any electronic mechanism should be
current dependent. However the number of broken bonds
is far less than the number of available electrons in the
cutting process. The excitations become possible because
of the large current available in the STM experiment.
The experimental range of currents during the cutting
process (more than 50 nA) is such that during the 1 ms
pulse more than thousand electrons are involved in inelastic events. This means that we are in a saturated regime
where cutting can in principle be achieved independent
of the current. This situation can be compared to the
situation of cutting Si:H bonds with an STM, where the
desorption yield was found to be independent of bias or
current once the bias is large enough

experimentally found that graphite surface would

the relevant elastic constants in their case are related to
the weak interlayer bonding in graphite as reflected in
the corresponding c33 and c44 elastic contansts. These
are much smaller than the c11 constant (reflecting the
strong intralayer sp2 -like bond) which is relevant in our
case (see Table II) [38]Using now Eqn. (1) and inserting Y 1 TPa, we find

strongly depending on N)The 10 change in the bond
lengths can lead to brittle behavior (see below) [11]All
this happens for electric fields of the order of 1 V/Å which
are in the experimental range. Notice that this pull of
electro-magnetic origin is happening over the length covered by the tip shape and drops dramatically outside the
tip providing a highly “distorted” region.

Now we address how the electronically and mechanically induced strain can lead to the breakdown of a tube.
A plausible mechanism is the Stone-Wales (SW) transformation leading to bond-rotation defects [24]This comprises of a pair of pentagon-heptagon defects obtained
by a simple C-C bond–rotation in the hexagonal network, see Fig. 6. These defects are the main source of
strain release for tubes under tension [11,12] and determine the overall electronic character of the tube [25]The
pentagon-heptagon defect behaves as a single edge dislocation in the tube circumference. Once nucleated, the
pair dislocations can relax further by successive StoneWales transformations.
We have performed molecular dynamics simulations of
strain-induced defect and plastic/brittle behavior using
the tight binding parameterization of Ref. [39] that reproduces quite well density-functional calculations within
the local-density-approximation [40]The computed
(T=0K) SW defect formation energy in an armchair nanotube at different applied strains shows that for a tensile
strain of about 5% for a (10,10) tube and 12% for a (12,0)
tube, the defect geometry is energetically favourable over

Now we address how the electronically and mechanically induced strain can lead to the breakdown of a tube.

unlikely that we are in this regime here.
[27] Removing or adding an electron from/to a tube bond
can introduce stresses in the network. So, for instance,
the bond length of the C2 -dimer increases from 1.24 to
1.30 Å when taking one electron out, which is a 5% effect.
However in more confined structures (e.g. benzene) the
effect is less relevant

reflects an average over the true force acting. There is
also a first order response which we should consider since
our system is truly microscopic. Within linear response
the total force F acting on the ions from an external field

Above this critical value the defect density increases
rapidly with length [12]Higher resolution and photon intensities can be achieved
by taking advantage of the optical-field enhancement at
the STM-tip when the tip-surface cavity is illuminated on
with a laser. The field enhancement factor is of the order of 1000 for typical STM-tips and substrates as highly
oriented pyrolytic graphite or gold (A.V. Bragas, S.M.
