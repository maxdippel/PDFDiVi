We elaborate on several observable consequences of the Quantum-Critical-Point scenario. In particular we show
that the strong k-dependent scattering of the quasiparticles with the quasi-critical charge and spin fluctuations
reproduces the main features of the low-energy spectral weights and of the observed Fermi surfaces. In the
underdoped cuprates the attractive k-dependent charge scattering drives the formation of the pseudogap at the
M points below the crossover temperature T In this context we discuss models for pseudogap formation with
relevant scattering in the particle-particle and particle-hole channels. The experimental consequences for the
pair-fluctuation and for the pseudogap behavior are investigated.

The charge fluctuations couple with spin degrees of freedom since in the hole-poor regions the
system is locally closer to half-filling where antiferromagnetic correlations are more pronounced.
Both charge and spin fluctuations then mediate a
nearly singular scattering between the quasiparticles, strongly affecting the spectral properties. In
order to compare the outcomes of this scattering
with the ARPES experiments, mostly performed
on optimally doped Bi2212

The interaction mediated by the quasicritical fluctuations also provides an effective pairing
mechanism. In this regard approaching the superconducting region from the overdoped regime, the

κ2 term in the QD and QC regimes give rise to a
non-trivial increase of Tc followed by a saturation
