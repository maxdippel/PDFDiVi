Abstract
In this paper we study in detail different types of topological solitons which
are possible in bilayer quantum Hall systems at filling fraction ν 1 when spin
degrees of freedom are included. Starting from a microscopic Hamiltonian we
derive an effective energy functional for studying such excitations. The gauge
invariance and CP 3 character of this energy fuctional and their consequences
are examined. Then we identify permissible classes of finite energy solutions
which are topologically non-trivial. We also numerically evaulate a representative solution in which a pseudospin (layer degrees of freedom) bimeron in a
given spin component is intertwined with spin-skyrmions in each layer and
and discuss whether it is energetically favoured as the lowest lying excitation
in such system with some numerical results.

Clearly there are prospects of even more esoteric excitations when both spin and pseudospin degrees of freedom are considered simultaneously. That is the theme of this present
work. We will continue to study the unit filling factor (ν 1) case. There has already
been some discussion of the combined spin-pseudospin ν 1 double layer system

A topologically non-trivial CP3 solution will generally involve an intertwined texture in
the physical spin in each layer as well as in the pseudospin of each physical spin projection.
One can ask whether such solutions can be legitimately interpreted as containing, as subsystems, spin-Skyrmions in either or both of the layers, possibly intertwined with a pseudospin

We also estimate the interaction energy of these solutions for some typical sets of values of
system parameters. We discuss the dependence of this energy on the separation between the
two meron centers. We find as expected, that if only the gradient and capacitance energies
are considered ,their minimisation will drive the textures towards zero size. Therefore we also
calculate the topological charge dependent Coulomb energy of our solutions which, being
repulsive should drive the merons farther apart, offsetting the above tendency towards zero
size. Then we extremise the total energy so obtained and find that it does show a minimum
at some optimal meron separation, for each value of layer separation.

<AND>
We also find that these energies are approximately of the same order as those of purely
spin Skyrmions of the single layer system. We make qualitative speculations on whether
or not our spin-pseudospin intertwined solitons can be energetically favoured over solitons
purely in spin or pseadospin, or over simple spin-flips.

We have solved the field equations numerically for the case where just the capacitance
term is added to the minimal CP3 energy ¿From our earlier calculations we know that
this term is going to change the solutions considerably. The terms in each equation with the
coefficient (ρs −ρl which accounts for the anisotropy in the exchange energy is not included
in the process of numerical integration. As a justification of such simplification we can say
that the anisotropic terms which involve higher order gradients of the spin pseudospin field
will have less pronounced effect compared to the capacitance term on the solutions. This
has been graphically shown in Fig. 1 and 2 of our earlier work

The interesting point to note about these solutions is that in Fig. 1 cos α approaches different (absolute) asymptotic values as η approaches These are respectively the centers
of the two merons that form the bimeron. Although computational limitations allow us to
go only upto values 0f η ±3, it is clear from the figure that asymptotic behavior has been
obtained This asymptotic behaviour is extracted directly from the analytic ansatz

The interesting point to note about these solutions is that in Fig. 1 cos α approaches different (absolute) asymptotic values as η approaches These are respectively the centers of the two merons that form the bimeron. Although computational limitations allow us to go only upto values 0f η 3, it is clear from the figure that asymptotic behavior has been obtained This asymptotic behaviour is extracted directly from the analytic ansatz

Here the length of the each arrow corresponds to the planar projection of the spin in the
upper layer (sin θu and the its direction gives the azimuthal angle (φu of the projected

To see whether this behaviour is common to other layer separations we have plotted in
fig.6 the total energy Etotal as a fuction of bimeron separation b for a set of layer separations.
The three sets of points in this figure corespond to three different layer separations, namely
d equal to .5l, .7l and .8l. All these three curves show distict minima for the total energy
as a function of bimeron separation. We have also provided in Table 2 the size (b) and total
energy of the optimal bimeron for five values of layer separation.

We found that resulting energy of these solitons at their optimal sizes varies very little as
one changes the layer separation. Although bimerons of larger size at lower layer separations
cost higher capacitance energy the decrease in the Coulomb energy seems to fully offset
that. As a result the total energy remains almost the same for different layer separations in
the range d 0.4l to d 0.8l that we have studied.
