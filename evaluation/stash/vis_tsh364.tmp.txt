In the last years, growing effort has been made in understanding traffic flow dynamics. Recent experiments
[1,2] show that traffic flow demonstrates complex physical phenomena, among which are:

The existence of three states: free flow, ”synchronized” (or ”fluctuative”flow and traffic jams (for
low, intermediate and high densities correspondingly)The second state has two essential features:
synchronization of flow in different lanes (for the
multilane traffic) and fluctuation performed by the
system in density-flux plane. Since our model is
single-lane we will refer to this state as ”fluctuative”Hysteresis which is observed in transitions between
the free and the fluctuative flow.

Modeling of traffic flow is traditionally performed using
two approaches. The microscopic, or car-following models approach, which describes the nearest-neighbor interaction between two consecutive cars and investigates its
influence on the flow (see e.g. [3-5]and the macroscopic, or continuous models approach, which represents
the flowing traffic as a continuous media and describes it

model both numerically and analytically and find the existence of three regimes in traffic flow: free flow regime at
low densities (where each car moves with almost a constant velocity)fluctuative flow regime at inetrmediate
densities (where stable periodic oscillations of velocities
of all cars are observed) and congested or jammed flow
regime at high densities (where due to high density all
the cars tend to move with the same, relatively small
velocity)Our model predicts the existence of many inhomogeneous stable states in the fluctuative regime and
demonstrates hysteresis in transitions between free and

A new single lane car following model of traffic flow is presented. The model is inertial and free of collisions. It demonstrates experimentally observed features of traffic flow such
as the existence of three regimes: free, fluctuative (synchronized) and congested (jammed) flow; bistability of free and
fluctuative states in a certain range of densities, which causes
the hysteresis in transitions between these states; jumps in
the density-flux plane in the fluctuative regime and gradual
spatial transition from synchronized to free flow. Our model
suggests that in the fluctuative regime there exist many stable
states with different wavelengths, and that the velocity fluctuations in the congested flow regime decay approximately
according to a power law in time.

The second term plays an important role when
vn vn+1 A car getting close to a much slower
car starts braking even if ∆xn ∆x0n This term
corresponds to the negative acceleration needed to
reduce vn to 0 as ∆xn D.

The dissipative third term is a repulsive force acting
when the velocity exceeds the permitted velocity.

Unlike optimal velocity models [5] the acceleration in

make the flow free of collisions.

In summary, we present a single lane car-following
model which explains important features of traffic observed experimentally. The model predicts the existence
of many stable periodic states in the fluctuative (synchronized) flow regime.
We wish to thank S. Schwarzer for usefull discussion.
